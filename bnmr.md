# β-NMR

β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) is a sensitive spectroscopic
technique well-suited for interrogating matter at the microscopic level.
It is quite akin to "conventional" magnetic resonance techniques
(e.g., [NMR], [EPR], [MRI], etc.),
but uses the high-energy β-emissions from
radioactive probe nuclei for signal detection.
In this sense, it is quite similar to muon spin rotation, relaxation, and
resonance ([μSR]), which shares the same detection scheme.
While the requirement of a radioactive source limits implementations
to specialized facilities (e.g., particle accelerators or nuclear reactors),
the technique is uniquely able to probe material environments
that are inaccessible through other means of study.

A modern implementation of the β-NMR technique can be found at
[TRIUMF]’s Isotope Separator and Accelerator (ISAC) facility in Vancouver, BC,
Canada.

An overview of the technique can be found in the recent review articles:

        NMR detected by radioactive beta decay, β-NMR, is undergoing a
        renaissance largely due to the availability of high intensity low energy
        beams of the most common probe ion, <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>, and
        dedicated facilities for materials research. The radioactive detection
        scheme, combined with the low energy ion beam, enable depth resolved NMR
        measurements in crystals, thin films and multilayers on depth scales of
        2-200 nm. After a brief historical introduction, technical aspects of
        implanted-ion β-NMR are presented, followed by a review of recent
        applications to a wide range of solids.

        Beta-detected NMR is a type of nuclear magnetic resonance that uses the
        asymmetric property of radioactive beta decay to provide a "nuclear"
        detection scheme. It is vastly more sensitive than conventional NMR on a
        per nuclear spin basis but requires a suitable radioisotope. I briefly
        present the general aspects of the method and its implementation at
        TRIUMF, where ion implantation of the NMR radioisotope is used to study
        a variety of samples including crystalline solids and thin films, and
        more recently, soft matter and even room temperature ionic liquids.
        Finally, I review the progress of the TRIUMF βNMR program in the period
        2015–2021.
