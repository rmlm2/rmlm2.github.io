# μSR

Muon spin rotation, relaxation, and resonance ([μSR]) is a sensitive nuclear
technique employing implanted spin-polarized (usually positive, sometimes
negative) muons (μ<sup>±</sup>) to study the local magnetic properties of
atomic, molecular, and crystalline environments. In this sense, it is closely
related to conventional magnetic resonnce techniques
(e.g., [NMR], [EPR], [MRI], etc.).
However, [μSR] uses the anisotropic property of β-decay for signal detection,
affording it with enhanced sensitivity.
Perhaps the most similar technique is [β-NMR]({% link bnmr.md %}), which shares
the same detection scheme, though it is much less well-known.

Many review articles and monographs have been written on the principles and
applications of [μSR], which can easily be found online.
For example, <https://muonsources.org/> provides lists of
[brochures](https://muonsources.org/resources/usr-literature/brochures/),
[books](https://muonsources.org/resources/usr-literature/books/),
and
[reviews](https://muonsources.org/resources/usr-literature/reviews/)
for those interested.
A nice, though somewhat old, introduction/overview of the technique is given in:
