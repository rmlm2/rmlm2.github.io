# μSR

Muon spin rotation, relaxation, and resonance (μSR) is a sensitive nuclear
technique employing implanted spin-polarized (usually positive, sometimes
negative) muons to study the local magnetic environment in atomic, molecular,
and crystalline systems. In this sense, it is closely related to conventional
magnetic resonnce techniques (e.g., [NMR] and [EPR]), but uses the anisotropic
property of β-decay for signal detection. In this sense, the most closely
related technique is β-NMR, though it is much less well-known.
