# μSR

Muon spin rotation, relaxation, and resonance ([μSR]) is a sensitive nuclear
technique employing implanted spin-polarized (usually positive, sometimes
negative) muons (μ<sup>±</sup>) to study the local magnetic properties of
atomic, molecular, and crystalline environments. In this sense, it is closely
related to conventional magnetic resonnce techniques
(e.g., [NMR], [EPR], [MRI], etc.).
However, [μSR] uses the anisotropic property of β-decay for signal detection,
affording it with enhanced sensitivity.
Perhaps the most similar technique is [β-NMR]({% link bnmr.md %}), which shares
the same detection scheme, though it is much less well-known.

Many review articles and monographs have been written on the principles and
applications of [μSR], which can easily be found online.
For example, <https://muonsources.org> provides lists of
[brochures](https://muonsources.org/resources/usr-literature/brochures/),
[books](https://muonsources.org/resources/usr-literature/books/),
and
[reviews](https://muonsources.org/resources/usr-literature/reviews/)
for those interested.
A nice, though somewhat old, introduction/overview of the technique is given in:

        Muons are particles with a spin of ½ that can be implanted into a wide
        range of condensed matter materials to act as a local probe of the
        surrounding atomic environment. Measurement of the muon’s precession and
        relaxation provides an insight into how it interacts with its local
        environment. From this, unique information is obtained about the static
        and dynamic properties of the material of interest. This has enabled
        muon spin spectroscopy, more commonly known as muon spin
        rotation/relaxation/resonance (μSR), to develop into a powerful tool to
        investigate material properties such as fundamental magnetism,
        superconductivity and functional materials. Alongside this, μSR may be
        used to study, for example, energy storage materials, ionic diffusion in
        potential batteries, the dynamics of soft matter, free radical
        chemistry, reaction kinetics, semiconductors, advanced manufacturing and
        cultural artefacts. This Primer is intended as an introductory article
        and introduces the μSR technique, the typical results obtained and some
        recent advances across various fields. Data reproducibility and
        limitations are also discussed, before highlighting promising future
        developments.
