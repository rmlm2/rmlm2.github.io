# SRIM

The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) is a collection of software
for calculations/simulations dealing with ion transport in matter.
This includes: ion stopping and range in targets, ion implantation, sputtering,
ion transmisstion, and ion beam therapy. Further details can be found at:
[http://www.srim.org/](http://www.srim.org/ "SRIM - The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter").

Though the software is free, it is closed source and writtin in (the now defunct
language) Visual Basic. Niether of these traits are particularly appealing (or
sensible) by modern standards. Nevertheless, it offers a user friendly interface
for a number of complicated tasks that are useful for many branches of science
(e.g., the stopping profile of an implanted ion).
