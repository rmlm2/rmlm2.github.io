        The formalism for a Monte Carlo computer program which simulates slowing
        down and scattering of energetic ions in amorphous targets is presented.
        It was developed for determining ion range and damage distributions as
        well as angular and energy distributions of backscattered and
        transmitted ions. The computer program provides particularly high
        computer efficiency, while still maintaining a high degree of accuracy.
        This is achieved mainly by applying a new analytic formula for
        determining nuclear scattering angles based on the Moli√®re potential,
        and by suitably expanding the distance between collisions at high
        energies. With these improvements it becomes feasible for the first time
        to assess accurately both low and high energy problems with high
        precision using a single simulation program.
