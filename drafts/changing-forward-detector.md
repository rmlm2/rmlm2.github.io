In 2020, the high-field spectrometer internals were modified to accomodate
measurements at higher temperatures (up to 400 K)!
In addition to this, it is necessary to swap out the <i>F</i>
(i.e., forward) detector for one compatible with the extended <i>T</i>-range.

A video explaining how to swap the two detectors
(and prevent the new one from metling)
can be found here:
