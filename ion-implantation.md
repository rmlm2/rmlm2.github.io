# Ion Implantation

Here I provide some notes on [ion implantion] - mainly computer simulation codes.

A good resource on the topic is:

        <dd>
        In this book the author discusses the investigation of ion bombardment
        of solids by computer simulation, with the aim of demonstrating the
        usefulness of this approach to the problem of interactions of ions with
        solids. The various chapters present the basic physics behind the
        simulation programs, their structure and many applications to different
        topics. The two main streams, the binary collision model and the
        classical dynamics model, are discussed, as are interaction potentials
        and electronic energy losses. The main topics investigated are
        backscattering, sputtering and implantation for incident atomic
        particles with energies from the eV to the MeV range. An extensive
        overview of the literature is given, making this book of interest to the
        active reseacher as well to students entering the field.
