# β-NMR

β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) is a sensitive spectroscopic
technique well-suited for interrogating matter at the microscopic level.
It is quite akin to "conventional" magnetic resonance techniques
(e.g., NMR, MRI, etc.), but uses the high-energy β-emissions from radioactive
probe nuclei for signal detection.
While the requirement of a radioactive source limits implementations
to specialized facilities (e.g., particle accelerators or nuclear reactors),
the technique is uniquely able to probe material environments
that are inaccessible through other means of study.

A modern implementation of the β-NMR technique can be found at
[TRIUMF](https://www.triumf.ca/)’s Isotope Separator and Accelerator (ISAC)
facility in Vancouver, BC.
