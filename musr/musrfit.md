# `musrfit`

`musrfit` is a data analysis framework for time-differential μSR data,
consisting of a suite of interoperating programs.
Through a custom scripted interface, the user can easily process, analyze, and
visualize their data, with sophisticated operations (e.g., global fitting of
<i>arbitrary</i> functions) made trivial.

        A free data-analysis framework for μSR has been developed. musrfit is
        fully written in C++, is running under GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, as well as
        Microsoft Windows, and is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL. It
        is based on the CERN ROOT framework and is utilizing the Minuit2
        optimization routines for fitting. It consists of a set of programmes
        allowing the user to analyze and visualize the data. The fitting process
        is controlled by an ASCII-input file with an extended syntax. A
        dedicated text editor is helping the user to create and handle these
        files in an efficient way, execute the fitting, show the data, get
        online help, and so on. A versatile tool for the generation of new input
        files and the extraction of fit parameters is provided as well. musrfit
        facilitates a plugin mechanism allowing to invoke user-defined
        functions. Hence, the functionality of the framework can be extended
        with a minimal amount of overhead for the user. Currently, musrfit can
        read the following facility raw-data files: PSI-BIN, MDU (PSI), ROOT
        (LEM/PSI), WKM (outdated ASCII format), MUD (TRIUMF), NeXus (ISIS).
