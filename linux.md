# Linux

[Linux] (or [GNU]/[Linux]) is a family of open source [Unix]-like compter
operating systems based on the [Linux] [Kernel].
It comes in many "flavours" (see e.g., <https://distrowatch.com/>), offering
unparalleled power/felxibility compared to commercial alternatives
(e.g., [Microsoft Windows]).

Though the learning curve is somewhat steep,
I find using [Linux] in my day-to-day life to be both efficient and pleasant.
