    The recently completed ISAC facility at TRIUMF is the most intense source of
    low-energy radioactive ions in the world. Beams of short-lived radioactive
    ions have applications in many different areas of physics including
    condensed matter research. At ISAC we are developing the technique of
    beta-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) as a tool for investigating
    thin structures and dilute impurities. Large nuclear spin polarization can
    be generated using a fast collinear laser method so that a beam of highly
    spin polarized ions can be implanted at low energies (1-90 keV). In this
    paper we describe the facility and the initial experimental program with
    emphasis on how this technique can complement μSR.

    A polarizer beam line at the radioactive beams facility ISAC at TRIUMF is
    nearly complete. Initially for <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> ions for β-NMR
    studies in condensed matter, it can in principle supply three or more
    experiments simultaneously, and the technique used is practicable with all
    alkali-metal ion beams. An atomic beam, created with over 90 % efficiency by
    passing the initial unpolarized 30 keV beam through a sodium vapor jet
    target, will be polarized by colinear optical pumping. A novel feature is
    that the atomic beam is reionized with demonstrated high efficiency in a
    helium gas target. The emittance growth through the helium cell has been
    measured for stable <sup>7</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> beam on a test stand and
    found to be small. We report these measurements as a function of helium flow
    rates. A preliminary polarized <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> run is planned for
    May, 2000.

    A spectrometer for β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) has been
    commissioned at the ISAC facility at TRIUMF. A beam of low energy highly
    spin polarized <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> can be decelerated and implanted
    into ultra-thin structures 6-400 nm thick. β-NMR provides local information
    on the electronic and magnetic properties of materials which is similar to
    conventional NMR but can be used as a sensitive probe of ultra-thin films,
    interfaces and other nanostructures. We report here on the status of the
    spectrometer and preliminary results on a simple metal film.

    The polarized beam line at ISAC relies on the well known technique of
    collinear optical pumping to polarize the nuclear spins of a low energy
    (10-60 keV) radioactive beam. Alkali-metal beams are longitudinally
    polarized by optical pumping of a fast atomic beam, which is created by
    charge exchange of the incident ion beam in a Na vapour cell. At ISAC, the
    beam is then reionized in a He gas target and directed to the experiments.
    To date, 30 keV beams of <sup>8</sup>Li and <sup>9</sup>Li have been
    polarized, and <sup>11</sup>Li and <sup>20</sup>Na beams are scheduled
    immediately following this conference. The polarization of the 8Li beam,
    using a dual frequency, standing wave Ti:sapphire laser, is up to ~80 %.
    High polarization is achieved by matching the laser bandwidth to the energy
    spread in the beam. The status of the facility is reported.

    Recently it has been demonstrated that low energy spin polarized radioactive
    nuclei can be used to probe the electronic and magnetic properties of
    ultra-thin samples using β detected NMR. However, use of the technique
    requires an accurate understanding of ion penetration depth and range
    straggling as a function of beam implantation energy and target density.
    Range straggling measurements of <sup>8</sup>Li were conducted with thin
    films of metallic Al and Au on sapphire and SrTiO<sub>3</sub> substrates and
    the results were compared to SRIM code predictions.

    We have commissioned a polarized low-energy <sup>8</sup>Li ion beam line,
    which together with a high-field β-NMR spectrometer, can act as sensitive
    new probe of thin films and interfaces. The implantation energy can be
    continuously adjusted from 1 to 90 keB and the maximum polarization achieved
    thus far is 80 %. This instrument opens up new applications for β-NMR which
    parallel and complement efforts with low-energy muons. For example, it is
    possible to probe the magnetic field distribution near the surface of a
    material by stopping a polarized <sup>8</sup>Li beam in a thin overlayer of
    Ag. Since the <sup>8</sup>Li adopts a site with cubic symmetry in Ag there
    is no quadrupolar splitting of the resonance, and the <sup>8</sup>Li acts as
    a purely magnetic sensor.

    We have measured the temperature dependence of the β-NMR resonances of
    <sup>8</sup>Li implanted in thin films of Au and Ag. At room temperature
    single narrow resonances are observed. The absence of appreciable
    quadrupolar splitting or broadening indicates that the Li is isolated and at
    a site of cubic symmetry. As the temperature is lowered, a second resonance
    appears which is shifted higher in frequency by ~100 ppm. We attribute the
    two lines to two distinct cubic sites with slightly different Knight shifts
    and discuss the application of this result to study fundamental phenomena
    exhibited by nano-confined metallic electrons.

    Hyperfine interactions of Na isotopes in single crystals have been studied

    and the initial distribution of the populations were measured. Such

    We report β-NMR measurements of the nuclear spin relaxation rate in a thin
    film of La<sub>0.67</sub>Ca<sub>0.33</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> (LCMO) using a
    low-energy beam of spin-polarized <sup>8</sup>Li. In a small magnetic field
    of 150 G, there is a broad peak in 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> near the Curie
    temperature (<i>T<sub>c</sub></i> = 295 K) and a dramatic decrease in
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> at lower temperatures. This is attributed to a
    critical slowing down of the spin fluctuations near <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> and
    freezing of the magnetic excitations at low temperatures, respectively. In
    addition, there is a small amplitude, slow relaxing component at high
    temperatures, which we attribute to <sup>8</sup>Li in the SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
    substrate. There is an indication that the spin relaxation rate in the
    substrate is also peaked at <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> due to close proximity to
    the magnetic film. These results establish that low-energy β-NMR can be used
    as a probe of magnetic fluctuations in magnetic thin films over a wide range
    of temperatures.

    Beta-detected NMR (β-NMR) of low-energy implanted <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>
    was studied in metallic palladium. The resonance was found to have a large
    negative shift with respect to the reference signal in the cubic insulator
    MgO. This shift exhibited significant temperature dependence on cooling
    below room temperature, approximately proportionate to the
    temperature-dependent spin susceptibility of pure Pd. Thus it is tentatively
    attributed to a Knight shift (<i>K</i>) caused by a large negative hyperfine
    coupling; a phenomenon common in transition metal ions, but not in alkalis.
    However, the spin-lattice relaxation of <sup>8</sup>Li is much slower than
    expected from the Korringa law for such a large <i>K</i>. We compare results
    from samples of very different thicknesses: 12.5 μm foil and a 100 nm thin
    film.

    A beam of low energy <sup>8</sup>Li has been used to probe the hyperfine
    field distribution in a magnetic multilayer composed of Au(4 nm)/Ag(80
    nm)/Fe(2 nm) grown on a GaAs substrate. The β-NMR frequency spectrum is
    shown to be a strong function of the implantation energy reflecting the
    depth dependence of the local hyperfine fields. Correlating the spectra with
    TRIM.SP implantation profiles allows us to identify signals from the GaAs,
    Ag and Au layers. The frequency spectrum in Ag is a strong function of
    energy. A very narrow line, and corresponding distribution of hyperfine
    fields, is observed when the beam in centered well away from the Fe whereas
    a much broader distribution is observed when the Li stops close to the Fe.
    These results demonstrate that low energy β-NMR can act as a sensitive probe
    of the induced magnetism in the otherwise non-magnetic Ag spacer layers.

    β-NMR of isolated <sup>8</sup>Li has been investigated in the normal state
    of 2H-NbSe<sub>2</sub>. In a high magnetic field of 3 T a single resonance
    is observed with a Gaussian line width of 3.5 kHz. The line shape varies
    weakly as function of magnetic field and temperature but has a strong
    orientation dependence. The nuclear electric quadrupole splitting is
    unresolved implying that the electric field gradients are 10-100 times
    smaller than in other non-cubic crystals. The nuclear spin relaxation rate
    is also anomalously small but varies linearly with temperature as expected
    for Korringa relaxation in a metal. These results suggest that Li adopts an
    interstitial position between the weakly coupled NbSe<sub>2</sub> layers and
    away from the conduction band.

    In this paper, we describe initial studies of the structure and dynamics
    associated with <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in bulk crystalline GaAs and Ge.
    At low temperatures in GaAs, the amplitude of the <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>
    resonance signal at ~3 T indicates that a large fraction (at least 70 %) of
    the Li end up in locations with cubic symmetry (i.e. the tetrahedral
    interstitial and substitutional sites). The linewidth of the β-NMR resonance
    increases dramatically above 150 K, reaches a maximum at about 290 K, and
    decreases again. This suggests that the Li starts to change its location,
    probably from an interstitial to a substitutional site, at ~150 K.
    Experiments in Ge are also described. In this sample, a narrow resonance is
    seen at low temperatures that is likely due to Li located at an interstitial
    site. Near room temperature, it appears that Li is converting to another
    site.

    Spin 1/2 probes have special importance in the field of NMR, since they have
    no electric quadrupole moment and are thus pure magnetic sensors. The
    absence of quadrupolar splittings greatly simplifies the NMR frequency
    spectrum. That the muon is spin 1/2 is one of the reasons it has become so
    useful as a magnetic probe. Until now there has been no spin 1/2 probe
    suitable for beta-detected NMR. Such a probe would be particularly useful in
    complex materials, which are in general non-cubic. In this paper we describe
    the development of a low energy beam of spin-polarised <sup>11</sup>Be,
    which is the lightest spin 1/2 isotope suitable for β-NMR. The intensity of
    the <sup>11</sup>Be<sup>+</sup> beam - generated by a laser ionisation
    source - is about 10<sup>6</sup>/s. The <sup>11</sup>Be nuclei are polarised
    by collinear laser optical pumping with an externally frequency doubled dye
    laser tuned to the
    <sup>2</sup><i>S</i><sub>1/2</sub>-<sup>2</sup><i>P</i><sub>1/2</sub>
    transition of <sup>11</sup>Be<sup>+</sup> at 313 nm.

    an epitaxially grown multilayer film consisting of Au(20 nm)/EuO(100
    nm)/LaAlO<sub>3</sub>, and investigate the nuclear spin relaxation at 3.33
    T. The relaxation varies with implantation energy below 28 keV as the
    fraction of the probe <sup>8</sup>Li stopping in each layer changes. We
    attribute the fast relaxating component to the EuO, while the much slower
    relaxation has contributions from both the Au and the substrate. However,
    fast relaxation is still observed at the lowest implantation energy where
    all the <sup>8</sup>Li stops in the Au capping layer. This may be due to a
    proximity effect from the EuO.

    which could be associated with TRSB order.

    A low energy beam of spin polarized <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> has been
    employed to study the magnetic field distribution in an epitaxial thin film
    of 5.4 % Mn doped GaAs(180 nm) on a (100) GaAs substrate via beta-detected
    NMR. The spectrum is a strong function of the implantation energy in the
    range 28-3 keV. In the magnetic layer, there is no indication of a missing
    fraction, and even more remarkable, there is a broad negatively shifted
    resonance. The spin lattice relaxation rate is, however, much faster in the
    Mn doped layer than in the substrate. A sharp peak characteristic of
    nonmagnetic GaAs is observed down to the lowest implantation energy, for
    which none of the Li should reach the substrate. This unexpected depth
    dependence is discussed.

    (Pt) film grown on a magnesium oxide (MgO) substrate. The frequency of the
    β-NMR resonance in Pt was compared to the MgO reference frequency to

    shift was found to be negative and strongly temperature dependent. The
    implications are discussed and compared to other transition metals that have
    been studied via β-NMR previously.

    The "cross-relaxation" method (also called "level-crossing resonance" or
    "avoided level-crossing") is a powerful technique that can be used to
    provide detailed structural and site information on impurities in materials.
    In this paper, we report on the development of the cross-relaxation
    technique for at the β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) facility
    located in TRIUMF in Vancouver. The measurements were carried out on a <110>
    Cu single crystal where the relaxation rate of the polarization was
    monitored as a function of the applied longitudinal magnetic field. The
    occurrence of cross-relaxation, at a particular magnetic field, between the
    and the surrounding nuclei is evident as a resonant enhancement of the
    relaxation rate at the level crossing field. We discuss inferences about the
    site and structure of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in Cu from this data.

    and β-NMR lineshape were measured as a function of temperature in a large

    due to the large nuclear dipolar interaction with the host <sup>27</sup>Al
    magnetic dipole moments. Nevertheless the temperature variation of the site
    averaged and Knight shift show evidence for a transition between the

    We investigate the 105 K structural phase transition in SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
    using depth controlled measurements of the spin relaxation of
    <sup>8</sup>Li. The measurements were performed in zero external magnetic
    field and rely on the local electric field gradient (EFG) at the crystalline
    implantation site of the <sup>8</sup>Li (<i>I</i> = 2) to hold the nuclear
    polarization. The tetragonal distortion accompanying the phase transition
    modifies the EFG in some <sup>8</sup>Li implantation sites, resulting in an
    observable loss of <sup>8</sup>Li polarization. This loss of polarization
    begins at a temperature <i>T</i><sup>*</sup>, indicating there is some loss
    of cubic symmetry well above the bulk transition. We find that the value of
    is unaffected by the range of implantation depths available (10-150 nm);
    however, the temperature dependence of the polarization depends on the
    surface preparation of the SrTiO<sub>3</sub> sample.

    The low-energy collinear laser beam line at ISAC routinely produces highly
    nuclear-spin polarized beams of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> for
    depth-controlled studies of thin films and near-surface phenomena. It also
    is used for nuclear structure and fundamental symmetry studies requiring
    other beams of polarized lithium and sodium isotopes. Further development of
    polarized <sup>20</sup>F and <sup>11</sup>Be beams is described, the latter
    in some detail. Laser fluorescence spectroscopy at high sensitivity using
    unpolarized bunched beams is briefly mentioned.

    A β-NQR spectrometer becomes a powerful tool to study changes in nuclear
    ground state properties along isotopic chains when coupled to a laser
    excitation beamline to polarise the nuclei of interest. Recently, the β-NQR
    technique in a zero magnetic field has been applied for the first-time to
    measure ratios of static nuclear quadrupole moments of <sup>8,9,11</sup>Li.
    Preliminary results of the experiment determining the ratios
    <i>Q</i><sub>9</sub>/<i>Q</i><sub>8</sub> and
    <i>Q</i><sub>11</sub>/<i>Q</i><sub>9</sub> show agreement with present
    literature values with improved precision.

  abstract: >-
    We present a method to measure the magnetic properties of monolayers and
    ultra-thin films of magnetic material. The method is based on low energy
    muon spin rotation and β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. A
    spin probe is used as a "proximal" magnetometer by implanting it in the
    substrate, just below the magnetic material. We calculate the expected
    magnetic field distribution sensed by the probe and discuss its temperature
    and implantation depth dependencies. This method is highly suitable for
    measuring the magnetic properties of monolayers of single molecule magnets,
    but can also be extended to ultra-thin magnetic films.

    To test for the microscopic magnetic phase separation in the dilute magnetic
    semiconductor Ga<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub>As suggested by low energy muon
    spin rotation measurements [1], we present a detailed analysis of the
    amplitudes of the <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance in an
    epitaxially grown thin film of x = 5.4 % Mn doped GaAs on a semi-insulating
    GaAs substrate with magnetic transition temperature <i>T<sub>C</sub></i> =
    72 K. The spectrum at 100 K corresponds to 73 % of the full room temperature
    amplitude, and at 60 K to about 62 %. The 11 % loss of signal through the
    magnetic transition is much smaller than that ~50 % found by low energy μSR
    [1], and may be entirely due to an amplitude change intrinsic to GaAs. This
    lack of evidence for phase separation is, however, consistent with the full
    volume fraction magnetism found by a second low energy μSR measurement on a
    different sample using weak transverse field [2].

    A beta-detected NMR experiment is carried out on a semi-insulating GaAs
    crystal using a low energy spin polarized <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> beam to
    investigate the magnetic properties as a function of temperature and depth.
    The range of depths probed, from ~137 nm down to ~17 nm, coincides with the
    region of electronic band-bending due to the surface. We ﬁnd a resonance
    broadened by the host nuclear dipoles, consistent with an earlier report
    [6], but using a pulsed radio frequency scheme, we are able to make higher
    resolution measurements. We ﬁnd a small negative shift of the resonance
    (relative to an MgO reference) at room temperature that is independent of
    depth. Remarkably, as the temperature is reduced below about 150 K, the
    resonance shifts negatively and becomes depth dependent, with a larger
    negative shift deeper into the sample. This shift saturates below 10 K, i.e.
    it does not follow a Curie's law that might be expected for dilute magnetic
    impurities. Possible origins are discussed.

    The strong collision model is used to calculate spin relaxation of a muon or

    show that on a time scale much longer than the mean time between collisions
    (fluctuations) the longitudinal polarization decays exponentially with a
    relaxation rate equal to a sum of Lorentzians - one for each frequency
    component in the static polarization function

    n order to investigate the diffusive motion of Li<sup>+</sup> in a thin film
    electrode material for Li-ion batteries, we have measured β-NMR spectra of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> ions implanted into epitaxial films of
    Li<sub>0.7</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub> and LiCoO<sub>2</sub> in the temperature
    range between 10 and 310 K. Below 100 K, the spin-lattice relaxation rate
    (1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>) in the Li<sub>0.7</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub> film
    increased with decreasing temperature, indicating the appearance and
    evolution of localized magnetic moments, as observed with μ<sup>+</sup>SR.
    As temperature is increased from 100 K, 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> starts to
    increase above ~200 K, where both Li-NMR and μ<sup>+</sup>SR also sensed an
    increase in 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> due to Li-diffusion. Interestingly, such
    diffusive behavior was found to depend on the implantation energy, possibly
    because the surface of the film is decomposed due to chemical instability of
    the Li<sub>0.7</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub> phase in air. Such diffusive behavior
    was not observed for the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> film up to 310 K.

    Low temperature growth methods were used to encapsulate a buried Mn δ-doping
    layer into a silicon host. A β-NMR investigation was performed of the
    magnetic properties in the temperature range 10-300 K using spin-polarized
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>. A depth-dependent broadening and shift of the
    NMR resonance was detected that is consistent with internal fields
    distributed at depths of 10-30 nm beneath the surface. At low temperatures,
    a negative relative shift occurred and the resonance was significantly
    broadened. At 300 K the line-shape could be described by a single Gaussian
    line, however, at 10 K the line is best approximated by a two component
    Lorentzian shape consisting of a broad and narrow component as anticipated
    for a diluted magnetic alloy. The overall magnitude of the resonance shift
    at both temperatures is small suggesting a weak interaction between the
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> and the magnetic Mn environment.

    overlapping multi-quantum transitions or motion of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> on the scale of its lifetime (1.21 s). We also

    resonance, consistent with a cubic <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> site, likely
    the tetrahedral interstitital, is used routinely as a reference for shift

    allowing a frequency determination to an accuracy of a few Hz. We find no
    implantation energy dependence of the resonance within a few ppm, but there
    is evidence of slow spin dynamics in hole-burning measurements. The spin
    lattice relaxation is slow. The temperature dependence reveals interesting
    changes at low temperature whose origin remains uncertain.

    Unlike the positive muon, we expect the chemistry of the implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> β-NMR probe in organic polymers to be simply that
    of the monovalent ion, but almost nothing is known about the NMR of isolated
    Li<sup>+</sup> in this context. Here, we present a brief survey of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> β-NMR in a variety of insulating polymers at high
    magnetic field, including polyimide, PET, polycarbonate, polystyrene and
    polyethylene oxide. In all cases, we find a large-amplitude, broad
    Lorentzian resonance near the Larmor frequency, consistent with the expected
    diamagnetic charge state. We also find remarkably fast spin-lattice
    relaxation rates 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>. There is very little dependence of
    either linewidth or 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> on the proton density, the main
    source of nuclear dipolar magnetic fields, leading us to conclude the main
    contribution to both broadening and spin relaxation at room temperature is
    quadrupolar in origin. This behaviour is very different from crystalline
    insulators such as MgO and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and suggests that
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> β-NMR will be an important probe of polymer
    dynamics. Additionally, we note dramatically different behaviour of one
    sample above its glass transition, motivating the construction of a high
    temperature spectrometer to enable further exploration at elevated
    temperature.

    Unlike the positive muon, β-NMR probe nuclei must be actively polarized. At
    the TRIUMF ISAC facility this is accomplished by in-flight collinear optical
    pumping with resonant circularly polarized laser light. This reliably
    produces a high degree of polarization, but the detailed state populations
    in the beam emerging from the optical polarizer are not well known. These
    populations are significant as they represent the initial state of the
    ensemble of probe spins implanted in a β-NMR experiment. Here we use the
    well-resolved quadrupolar split spectrum of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in a
    high purity single crystal of bismuth to extract the sublevel populations
    under typical polarizer operating conditions, accounting for the spin
    relaxation in this semimetal.

    guide field as the beam was transported via electrostatic bends into a 2.5 T
    longitudinal magnetic field. There the beam was implanted into a single
    crystal MgO target and the beta decay asymmetry was measured. Both hyperfine
    ground states were optically pumped with a single frequency light source,
    using segmentation of the beam energy, which boosted the polarization by
    approximately 50 % compared to pumping a single ground state. The total
    decay asymmetry of 0.06 and beam intensity were sufficient to provide a
    useful spin-1/2 beam for future BNMR experiments. A variant of the method
    was used previously to optically pump the full Doppler-broadened absorption
    profile of a beam of <sup>11</sup>Be<sup>+</sup> with a single-frequency
    light source.

    The span of most chemical shifts recorded in conventional
    <sup>25</sup>Mg-NMR spectroscopy is ~100 ppm. Accordingly, linewidths of ~10
    ppm or better are desirable to achieve adequate resolution for applications
    in chemistry. Here we present first high-field <sup>31</sup>Mg-β-NMR
    measurements of <sup>31</sup>Mg<sup>+</sup> ions implanted into a MgO single
    crystal carried out at the ISAC facility at TRIUMF. The resonances recorded
    at 2.5 T and 3.5 T show strong linewidth dependency on the applied RF power,
    ranging from ~419 ppm for the highest RF power down to ~48 ppm for the
    lowest one.

  abstract: >-
    Advances in the use of μSR and β-NMR are driven by technical developments.
    New methods were developed which allowed us to learn surprising things about
    muonium in semiconductors, its electronic structure, its relationship to
    hydrogen, its ability to diffuse via quantum tunneling, and its
    metastability. Similarly in the area of high Tc superconductors new
    capabilities in spectrometer design led to new information on the properties
    of superconducting vortices and how they interact. The development of low
    energy β-NMR at TRIUMF and LE-μSR at PSI has made it possible to study
    electronic and magnetic properties of thin films and interfaces where
    conventional NMR lacks the required sensitivity. Low energy β-NMR is almost
    identical to μSR in principle, but the longer lifetime of <sup>8</sup>Li
    allows one to probe the system on a very different time scale. In this sense
    β-NMR can be viewed as a complement or extension of μSR.

    Here we report the temperature and applied magnetic field dependence of the
    spin lattice relaxation of implanted into Au foil in the range 4 to 290 K
    and 3 to 150 G. Below about 50 G, relaxation due to the dynamic host lattice
    nuclear spins is important, becoming dominant below 20 G. At 150 G, this
    process is quenched, and the relaxation is Korringa-like. We report the
    first measurement of its temperature dependence which shows the
    characteristic features of the site change around 190 K. At lower field the
    relaxation is two component above 100 K and exhibits a strong peak at the
    site change, which we attribute to quadrupolar relaxation of the adjacent Au
    spins. We discuss the ingredients required for a quantitative theory of the
    low field relaxation.

    It is widely believed that a space-charge layer (SCL) exists at the vicinity
    of a boundary between a solid electrolyte layer and electrode layer in an
    all solid-state Li-ion battery due to the difference of their chemical
    potentials, although there are no direct experimental evidences. Here, the
    Li concentration is predicted to decrease drastically in the SCL. In order
    to clarify whether SCL exists or not, we have attempted to measure the
    <sup>8</sup>Li β-NMR spectrum for a multilayer sample, MgO (50
     nm)/Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (70  nm)/LiCoO<sub>2</sub> (200  nm) as a
    function of implanted energy of <sup>8</sup>Li. The resonance spectrum was
    fitted by a combination of two Lorentzians and one background signal.
    Furthermore, the line width of the resonance signal from the
    Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> layer is found to become broad towards the
    boundary with the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> layer. This is consistent with the
    presence of an SCL.

    relaxation in other organic materials and shows a stretched exponential
    behavior typical of glasses with a small stretching exponent β = 0.3. At low
    temperature, there is little or no difference between the two glasses, while
    above 250 K, the relaxation in the denser ultrastable form is faster. In

    Using <sup>8</sup>Li β-NMR we studied the temperature dependence of the
    spin-lattice relaxation in LaAlO<sub>3</sub> in high magnetic field. The
    relaxation in LAO is composed of two components: a fast-relaxing signal with
    a small amplitude, and a large amplitude, slow relaxing component. The data
    was fit using a highly-constrained model which assumes that the temperature
    dependence of the slow and fast component is the same at all temperatures.
    The <sup>8</sup>Li relaxation suggests a <i>T</i><sup>2</sup> temperature

    satellites, with a similar pattern to that observed in SrTiO<sub>3</sub>. In

    relaxation at 6.55 T, for both solid solutions, is very slow; while at

    It has long been desirable to develop a spin-1/2 nucleus as a probe for
    β-detected NMR studies of solid materials. As a pure magnetic probe, it
    would greatly compliment our most extensively used nucleus <sup>8</sup>Li
    (spin-2), which is sensitive to both dipolar and quadrupolar interactions.
    Following the recent successful polarization of spin-1/2 <sup>31</sup>Mg at
    TRIUMF, we report here on its use to study solids where host magnesium atoms
    occupy lattice sites with cubic symmetry - a situation most directly
    comparable to (stable) <sup>25</sup>Mg NMR. We show preliminary results in:
    rocksalt MgO; spinel MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>; and antifluorite
    Mg<sub>2</sub>Si, which is an interesting semiconducting thermoelectric.
    Deviations from the results with conventional <sup>25</sup>Mg NMR are
    attributed to the systematics associated with the β-NMR technique. The
    <sup>31</sup>Mg decay chain is found to complicate the extraction of
    spin-lattice relaxation rates due to a time-dependent background signal
    introduced by its progeny. The prospect of further use of 31Mg as a β-NMR
    probe for the study of condensed matter is good.

    We demonstrate that the ratio of 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> spin-lattice
    relaxation rates (SLR) of two different isotopes (here <sup>8</sup>Li and
    <sup>9</sup>Li) can be used in order to identify the predominant relaxation
    mechanism within the β-NMR technique. We studied with both isotopes a Pt
    foil and two samples of single crystal SrTiO<sub>3</sub>. In Pt, the ratio
    of the SLR rates was 6.82(29), which is close to but less than the
    theoretical limit of ~7.68 for pure magnetic relaxation. In
    SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, the weighted averaged SLR ratio of the two samples was
    2.7(3), which is close but larger than the theoretical limit of ~2.14
    expected for pure electric quadrupolar relaxation. This indicates that the
    primary source of relaxation in SrTiO<sub>3</sub> is electric quadrupolar in
    origin and that magnetic effects have a much smaller importance in this
    material. The low effective asymmetry of <sup>9</sup>Li was the dominant
    cause of uncertainty of the measurements in this study. We propose a system
    of tagging the beta-decays in coincidence with the alpha decays that take
    place in two of the three primary decay channels of <sup>9</sup>Li as a way
    of increasing the effective asymmetry and enhance the signal of
    <sup>9</sup>Li β-NMR.

    for free under the terms of the GNU GPL standards. The GUI is structured in
    tabs to search, plot and analyze data, along other functionalities. The user
    can tweak the minimization options; and fit multiple data files (or runs)
    using single or global fitting routines with pre-defined or new models.
    Currently, BnmrOffice reads TRIUMF’s MUD data and ASCII files, and can be

  author:
    - J. Sugiyama
  abstract: >-
    Spin polarized particles exhibiting beta decay, such as, muon and
    <sup>8</sup>Li are very useful for detecting internal magnetic fields in
    solids. Here, I review our attempts to use these spin polarized beams for
    battery materials research. Due to a unique lifetime and gyromagnetic ratio
    of muon, a positive muon spin rotation and relaxation (µ<sup>+</sup>SR)
    technique is very popular for studying microscopic internal magnetic fields
    in condensed matters caused by electron and nuclear magnetism. Particularly
    in 2009, it was found that Li<sup>+</sup> ion diffusion in
    Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>, which is the most common cathode material in
    a Li-ion battery, is detectable with µ<sup>+</sup>SR even under the
    presence of paramagnetic Co ions
    (Sugiyama et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. <b>103</b>, 147601, 2009),
    while NMR is unable to do so due to the effect of localized magnetic moments
    on a spin-lattice relaxation rate. Such finding opened the door for
    µ<sup>+</sup>SR on energy materials research. Since then, many battery
    materials have been investigated with µ<sup>+</sup>SR in order to determine
    their intrinsic diffusion coefficient (<i>D</i>) of Li<sup>+</sup> and
    Na<sup>+</sup> ions. Furthermore, using such intrinsic <i>D</i>, the other
    important parameters are successfully derived, such as, the reactive surface
    area, diffusion pathway, and density of mobile ions. In 2018, we have
    initiated to measure internal magnetic fields in solids with a negative
    muon, i.e. a µ<sup>-</sup>SR technique, in J-PARC
    (Sugiyama et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. <b>121</b>, 087202, 2018).
    This will provide a new insight for microscopic internal magnetic fields
    from lattice sites, while µ<sup>+</sup>SR does so from interstitial sites.
    On the contrary, a long lifetime of <sup>8</sup>Li (1.21 s) makes a
    <sup>8</sup>Li β-NMR technique suitable for detecting both concentration and
    diffusion of Li in solids. Particularly in TRIUMF, since the implantation
    energy of <sup>8</sup>Li is tunable from almost 0 to about 28 keV, we can
    measure both spin-lattice relaxation rate and spin-spin relaxation rate as a
    function of depth up to about 200 nm, as well as µ<sup>+</sup>SR using a low
    energy muon beam in PSI. These will clarify whether the space charge layer
    of Li<sup>+</sup> exists at the interface between electrode and electrolyte
    material.
