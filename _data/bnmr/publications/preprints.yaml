    Used to store the results of μSR measurements at TRIUMF, the Muon Data (MUD)
    file format serves as a useful and flexible scheme that is both lightweight
    and self-describing. The application programming interface (API) for these
    files is written in C and FORTRAN, languages not known for their ease of
    use. In contrast, Python is a language which emphasizes rapid prototyping
    and readability. This work describes three Python 3 packages to interface
    with MUD files and analyze their contents: mudpy, bdata, and bfit. The first
    enables easy access to the contents of any MUD file. The latter two are
    implemented specifically for the implanted-ion β-detected NMR (β-NMR)
    experiment at TRIUMF. These tools provide both an API and graphical user
    interface (GUI) to help users extract and fit β-NMR data.

    We report β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance of ultra-dilute
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite
    (HOPG). The absence of motional narrowing and diffusional spin-lattice
    relaxation implies Li<sup>+</sup> is not appreciably mobile up to 400 K, in
    sharp contrast to the highly lithiated stage compounds. However, the
    relaxation is remarkably fast and persists down to cryogenic temperatures.
    Ruling out extrinsic paramagnetic impurities and intrinsic ferromagnetism,
    we conclude the relaxation is due to paramagnetic centers correlated with
    implantation. While the resulting effects are not consistent with a Kondo
    impurity, they also differ from free paramagnetic centers, and we suggest
    that a resonant scattering approach may account for much of the observed
    phenomenology.
