    Used to store the results of μSR measurements at TRIUMF, the Muon Data (MUD)
    file format serves as a useful and flexible scheme that is both lightweight
    and self-describing. The application programming interface (API) for these
    files is written in C and FORTRAN, languages not known for their ease of
    use. In contrast, Python is a language which emphasizes rapid prototyping
    and readability. This work describes three Python 3 packages to interface
    with MUD files and analyze their contents: mudpy, bdata, and bfit. The first
    enables easy access to the contents of any MUD file. The latter two are
    implemented specifically for the implanted-ion β-detected NMR (β-NMR)
    experiment at TRIUMF. These tools provide both an API and graphical user
    interface (GUI) to help users extract and fit β-NMR data.

    We report direct measurements of the magnetic field screening at the limits
    of the Meissner phase for two superconducting Nb samples. The samples are
    processed with two different surface treatments that have been developed for
    superconducting radio-frequency cavity applications - a "baseline" treatment
    and an oxygen-doping ("O-doping") treatment. The measurements show: 1) that
    the screening length is significantly longer in the "O-doping" sample
    compared to the "baseline" sample; 2) that the screening length near the
    limits of the Meissner phase increases with applied field; 3) the evolution
    of the screening profile as the material transitions from the Meissner phase
    to the mixed phase; and 4) a demonstration of the absence of any screening
    profile for the highest applied field, indicative of the full flux entering
    the sample. Measurements are performed utilizing the -detected nuclear
    magnetic resonance (β-NMR) technique that allows depth resolved studies of
    the local magnetic field within the first 100 nm of the surface. The study
    takes advantage of the β-SRF beamline, a new facility at TRIUMF, Canada,
    where field levels up to 200 mT are available parallel to the sample
    surface to replicate radio frequency (RF) fields near the Meissner breakdown
    limits of Nb.
