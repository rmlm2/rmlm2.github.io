    We report β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) measurements in
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>:Ca (BSC) and Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>:Mn
    (BTM) single crystals using <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted to depths
    on the order of 100 nm. Above ~200 K, spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) reveals
    diffusion of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>, with activation energies of ~0.4 eV
    (~0.2 eV) in BSC (BTM). At lower temperatures, the nuclear magnetic
    resonance (NMR) properties are those of a heavily doped semiconductor in the
    metallic limit, with Korringa relaxation and a small, negative,
    temperature-dependent Knight shift in BSC. From this, we make a detailed
    comparison with the isostructural tetradymite Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>2</sub>Se
    (BTS) [McFadden et al., Phys Rev. B 99, 125201 (2019)]. In the magnetic BTM,
    the effects of the dilute Mn moments predominate, but remarkably the
    <sup>8</sup>Li signal is not wiped out through the magnetic transition at 13
    K, with a prominent critical peak in the SLR that is suppressed in a high
    applied field. This detailed characterization of the <sup>8</sup>Li NMR
    response is an important step towards using depth-resolved β-NMR to study
    the low-energy properties of the chiral topological surface state (TSS).
    With the bulk NMR response now established in several
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Ch<sub>3</sub> tetradymite topological insulators (TIs), the
    prospect of directly probing their chiral TSS using the depth resolution
    afforded by β-NMR remains strong.

    Used to store the results of μSR measurements at TRIUMF, the Muon Data (MUD)
    file format serves as a useful and flexible scheme that is both lightweight
    and self-describing. The application programming interface (API) for these
    files is written in C and FORTRAN, languages not known for their ease of
    use. In contrast, Python is a language which emphasizes rapid prototyping
    and readability. This work describes three Python 3 packages to interface
    with MUD files and analyze their contents: mudpy, bdata, and bfit. The first
    enables easy access to the contents of any MUD file. The latter two are
    implemented specifically for the implanted-ion β-detected NMR (β-NMR)
    experiment at TRIUMF. These tools provide both an API and graphical user
    interface (GUI) to help users extract and fit β-NMR data.
