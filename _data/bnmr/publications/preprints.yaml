    Used to store the results of μSR measurements at TRIUMF, the Muon Data (MUD)
    file format serves as a useful and flexible scheme that is both lightweight
    and self-describing. The application programming interface (API) for these
    files is written in C and FORTRAN, languages not known for their ease of
    use. In contrast, Python is a language which emphasizes rapid prototyping
    and readability. This work describes three Python 3 packages to interface
    with MUD files and analyze their contents: mudpy, bdata, and bfit. The first
    enables easy access to the contents of any MUD file. The latter two are
    implemented specifically for the implanted-ion β-detected NMR (β-NMR)
    experiment at TRIUMF. These tools provide both an API and graphical user
    interface (GUI) to help users extract and fit β-NMR data.

    A new high field spectrometer has been built to extend the capabilities of
    the β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) facility at TRIUMF. This
    new beamline extension allows β-NMR spectroscopy to be performed with fields
    up to 200 mT parallel to a sample's surface (perpendicular to the ion beam),
    allowing depth-resolved studies of local electromagnetic fields with spin
    polarized probes at a much higher applied magnetic field than previously
    available in this configuration. The primary motivation and application is
    to allow studies of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) materials, close
    to the critical fields of Nb metal, which is extensively used to fabricate
    SRF cavities. The details of the design considerations and implementation of
    the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system, ion optics, beam diagnostics are
    presented here. Commissioning of the beamline and spectrometer with
    radioactive ions are also reported here. Future capabilities and
    applications in other areas are also described.
