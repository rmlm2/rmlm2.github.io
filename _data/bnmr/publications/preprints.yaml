    Used to store the results of μSR measurements at TRIUMF, the Muon Data (MUD)
    file format serves as a useful and flexible scheme that is both lightweight
    and self-describing. The application programming interface (API) for these
    files is written in C and FORTRAN, languages not known for their ease of
    use. In contrast, Python is a language which emphasizes rapid prototyping
    and readability. This work describes three Python 3 packages to interface
    with MUD files and analyze their contents: mudpy, bdata, and bfit. The first
    enables easy access to the contents of any MUD file. The latter two are
    implemented specifically for the implanted-ion β-detected NMR (β-NMR)
    experiment at TRIUMF. These tools provide both an API and graphical user
    interface (GUI) to help users extract and fit β-NMR data.

    We report measurements of the Meissner screening profile in a
    Nb(300 nm)/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thin film using <sup>8</sup>Li
    β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR). The NMR probe <sup>8</sup>Li
    was ion-implanted into the Nb film at energies ≤ 20 keV, corresponding to
    mean stopping depths comparable to Nb's magnetic penetration depth <i>λ</i>.
    <sup>8</sup>Li's strong dipole-dipole coupling with the host <sup>93</sup>Nb
    nuclei provided a "cross-relaxation" channel that dominated in low magnetic
    fields, which conferred indirect sensitivity to the local magnetic field via
    the spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) rate 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>. From a fit of
    the 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> data to a model accounting for its dependence on
    temperature, magnetic field, and <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implantation
    energy, we obtained a magnetic penetration depth <i>λ</i><sub>0</sub> =
    51.5(22) nm, consistent with a relatively short carrier mean-free-path
    <i>ℓ</i> = 18.7(29) nm typical of similarly prepared Nb films. The results
    presented here constitute an important step towards using <sup>8</sup>Li
    β-NMR to characterize bulk Nb samples with engineered surfaces, which are
    often used in the fabrication of particle accelerators.

    We report β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance of ultra-dilute
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite
    (HOPG). The absence of motional narrowing and diffusional spin-lattice
    relaxation implies Li<sup>+</sup> is not appreciably mobile up to 400 K, in
    sharp contrast to the highly lithiated stage compounds. However, the
    relaxation is remarkably fast and persists down to cryogenic temperatures.
    Ruling out extrinsic paramagnetic impurities and intrinsic ferromagnetism,
    we conclude the relaxation is due to paramagnetic centers correlated with
    implantation. While the resulting effects are not consistent with a Kondo
    impurity, they also differ from free paramagnetic centers, and we suggest
    that a resonant scattering approach may account for much of the observed
    phenomenology.
