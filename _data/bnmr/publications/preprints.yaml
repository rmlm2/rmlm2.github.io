    Used to store the results of μSR measurements at TRIUMF, the Muon Data (MUD)
    file format serves as a useful and flexible scheme that is both lightweight
    and self-describing. The application programming interface (API) for these
    files is written in C and FORTRAN, languages not known for their ease of
    use. In contrast, Python is a language which emphasizes rapid prototyping
    and readability. This work describes three Python 3 packages to interface
    with MUD files and analyze their contents: mudpy, bdata, and bfit. The first
    enables easy access to the contents of any MUD file. The latter two are
    implemented specifically for the implanted-ion β-detected NMR (β-NMR)
    experiment at TRIUMF. These tools provide both an API and graphical user
    interface (GUI) to help users extract and fit β-NMR data.

    A new high field spectrometer has been built to extend the capabilities of
    the β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) facility at TRIUMF. This
    new beamline extension allows β-NMR spectroscopy to be performed with fields
    up to 200 mT parallel to a sample's surface (perpendicular to the ion beam),
    allowing depth-resolved studies of local electromagnetic fields with spin
    polarized probes at a much higher applied magnetic field than previously
    available in this configuration. The primary motivation and application is
    to allow studies of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) materials, close
    to the critical fields of Nb metal, which is extensively used to fabricate
    SRF cavities. The details of the design considerations and implementation of
    the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system, ion optics, beam diagnostics are
    presented here. Commissioning of the beamline and spectrometer with
    radioactive ions are also reported here. Future capabilities and
    applications in other areas are also described.

    We report measurements of the Meissner screening profile in a
    Nb(300 nm)/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thin film using <sup>8</sup>Li
    β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR). The NMR probe <sup>8</sup>Li
    was ion-implanted into the Nb film at energies ≤ 20 keV, corresponding to
    mean stopping depths comparable to Nb's magnetic penetration depth <i>λ</i>.
    <sup>8</sup>Li's strong dipole-dipole coupling with the host <sup>93</sup>Nb
    nuclei provided a "cross-relaxation" channel that dominated in low magnetic
    fields, which conferred indirect sensitivity to the local magnetic field via
    the spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) rate 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>. From a fit of
    the 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> data to a model accounting for its dependence on
    temperature, magnetic field, and <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implantation
    energy, we obtained a magnetic penetration depth <i>λ</i><sub>0</sub> =
    51.5(22) nm, consistent with a relatively short carrier mean-free-path
    <i>ℓ</i> = 18.7(29) nm typical of similarly prepared Nb films. The results
    presented here constitute an important step towards using <sup>8</sup>Li
    β-NMR to characterize bulk Nb samples with engineered surfaces, which are
    often used in the fabrication of particle accelerators.
