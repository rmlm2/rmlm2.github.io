    Used to store the results of μSR measurements at TRIUMF, the Muon Data (MUD)
    file format serves as a useful and flexible scheme that is both lightweight
    and self-describing. The application programming interface (API) for these
    files is written in C and FORTRAN, languages not known for their ease of
    use. In contrast, Python is a language which emphasizes rapid prototyping
    and readability. This work describes three Python 3 packages to interface
    with MUD files and analyze their contents: mudpy, bdata, and bfit. The first
    enables easy access to the contents of any MUD file. The latter two are
    implemented specifically for the implanted-ion β-detected NMR (β-NMR)
    experiment at TRIUMF. These tools provide both an API and graphical user
    interface (GUI) to help users extract and fit β-NMR data.

    Using ion-implanted <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected NMR, we study the evolution of
    the correlated metallic state of LaNiO<sub>3</sub> in a series of
    LaNiO<sub>3</sub>/LaAlO<sub>3</sub> superlattices as a function of bilayer
    thickness. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements in an applied field of 6.55
    T reveal two equal amplitude components: one with metallic (<i>T</i>-linear)
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, and a second with a more complex
    <i>T</i>-dependence. The metallic character of the slow relaxing component
    is only weakly affected by the LaNiO<sub>3</sub> thickness, while the fast
    component is much more sensitive, exhibiting the opposite temperature
    dependence (increasing towards low <i>T</i>) in the thinnest, most magnetic
    samples. The origin of this bipartite relaxation is discussed.
