    Used to store the results of μSR measurements at TRIUMF, the Muon Data (MUD)
    file format serves as a useful and flexible scheme that is both lightweight
    and self-describing. The application programming interface (API) for these
    files is written in C and FORTRAN, languages not known for their ease of
    use. In contrast, Python is a language which emphasizes rapid prototyping
    and readability. This work describes three Python 3 packages to interface
    with MUD files and analyze their contents: mudpy, bdata, and bfit. The first
    enables easy access to the contents of any MUD file. The latter two are
    implemented specifically for the implanted-ion β-detected NMR (β-NMR)
    experiment at TRIUMF. These tools provide both an API and graphical user
    interface (GUI) to help users extract and fit β-NMR data.

    We report on the stability and magnetic state of ion implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li in single crystals of the semiconductor ZnO using β-detected
    nuclear magnetic resonance. At ultradilute concentrations, the spectra
    reveal distinct Li sites from 7.6 to 400 K. Ionized shallow donor
    interstitial Li is stable across the entire temperature range, confirming
    its ability to self-compensate the acceptor character of its (Zn)
    substitutional counterpart. Above 300 K, spin-lattice relaxation indicates
    the onset of correlated local motion of interacting defects, and the spectra
    show a site change transition from disordered configurations to
    substitutional. Like the interstitial, the substitutional shows no resolved
    hyperfine splitting, indicating it is also fully ionized above 210 K. The
    electric field gradient at the interstitial <sup>8</sup>Li exhibits
    substantial temperature dependence with a power law typical of non-cubic
    metals.
