    The new ISAC facility at TRIUMF (Canada), produces some of the world's most
    intense radioactive ion beams (RIBs). Although the primary scientific
    motivation for these facilities lies in nuclear physics and nuclear
    astrophysics, RIBs also have applications in condensed matter (CM). Many
    pioneering CM experiments have already been performed at the ISOLDE facility
    (CERN). Continuing on this path at ISAC we have recently polarized a beam of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> to be used as a magnetic probe of ultra-thin
    films and interfaces. We report here on progress in developing this new
    application of low energy RIBs, which is based on the technique of
    β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR).

    The ISAC facility at TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada, produces intense beams of
    radioactive ions that are used in a broad research program encompassing
    fundamental properties of nuclei, nuclear astrophysics, medical physics,
    condensed matter physics, and physical chemistry. The focus of this article
    is on the latter subject and in particular recent developments in the use of
    β-detected NMR to probe electronic, magnetic, and structural properties of
    thin films and interfaces. Over the last 10 years considerable progress has
    been made developing the technique and applying it to current problems.

    The β-NMR facility at ISAC is constructed specifically for experiments in
    condensed matter physics with radioactive ion beams. Using co-linear optical
    pumping, a <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> ion beam having a large nuclear spin
    polarisation and low energy (nominally 30 keV) can be generated. When
    implanted into materials these ions penetrate to shallow depths comparable
    to length scales of interest in the physics of surfaces and interfaces
    between materials. Such low-energy ions can be decelerated with simple
    electrostatic optics to enable depth-resolved studies of near-surface
    phenomena over the range of about 2-200 nm. Since the β-NMR signal is
    extracted from the asymmetry intrinsic to beta-decay and therefore monitors
    the polarisation of the radioactive probe nuclear magnetic moments, this
    technique is fundamentally a probe of local magnetism. More generally
    though, any phenomena which affects the polarisation of the implanted spins
    by, for example, a change in resonance frequency, line width or relaxation
    rate can be studied. The β-NMR program at ISAC currently supports a number
    of experiments in magnetism and superconductivity as well as novel
    ultra-thin heterostructures exhibiting properties that cannot occur in bulk
    materials. The general purpose zero/low field and high field spectrometers
    are configured to perform CW and pulsed RF nuclear magnetic resonance and
    spin relaxation experiments over a range of temperatures (3-300 K) and
    magnetic fields (0-9 T).

  abstract: >-
    NMR detected by radioactive beta decay, β-NMR, is undergoing a renaissance
    largely due to the availability of high intensity low energy beams of the
    most common probe ion, <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>, and dedicated facilities
    for materials research. The radioactive detection scheme, combined with the
    low energy ion beam, enable depth resolved NMR measurements in crystals,
    thin films and multilayers on depth scales of 2-200 nm. After a brief
    historical introduction, technical aspects of implanted-ion β-NMR are
    presented, followed by a review of recent applications to a wide range of
    solids.

  abstract: >-
    Beta-detected NMR is a type of nuclear magnetic resonance that uses the
    asymmetric property of radioactive beta decay to provide a "nuclear"
    detection scheme. It is vastly more sensitive than conventional NMR on a per
    nuclear spin basis but requires a suitable radioisotope. I briefly present
    the general aspects of the method and its implementation at TRIUMF, where
    ion implantation of the NMR radioisotope is used to study a variety of
    samples including crystalline solids and thin films, and more recently, soft
    matter and even room temperature ionic liquids. Finally, I review the
    progress of the TRIUMF βNMR program in the period 2015-2021.
