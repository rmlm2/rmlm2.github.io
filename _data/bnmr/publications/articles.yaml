    A nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectrum of <sup>8</sup>Li has been
    observed in a single crystal of SrTiO<sub>3</sub> using a beam of low-energy
    highly polarized radioactive <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>. The resonances were
    detected by monitoring the β-decay anisotropy as a function of a small audio
    frequency magnetic field. These results demonstrate that low energy nuclear
    spin polarized <sup>8</sup>Li can be used as a sensitive probe of the local
    magnetic and electronic environment in nanostructures and ultrathin films in
    zero static applied magnetic field.

    Depth-controlled β-NMR can be used to probe the magnetic properties of thin
    films and interfaces on a nanometer length scale. A 30 keV beam of highly
    spin-polarized <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> ions was slowed down and implanted
    into a 50 nm film of Ag deposited on a SrTiO<sub>3</sub> substrate. A novel
    high field β-NMR spectrometer was used to observe two well resolved
    resonances which are attributed to Li occupying substitutional and
    octahedral interstitial sites in the Ag lattice. The temperature dependence
    of the Knight shifts and spin relaxation rates are consistent with the
    Korringa law for a simple metal, implying that the NMR of implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li reflects the spin suspectibility of bulk metallic silver.

    The new ISAC facility at TRIUMF (Canada), produces some of the world's most
    intense radioactive ion beams (RIBs). Although the primary scientific
    motivation for these facilities lies in nuclear physics and nuclear
    astrophysics, RIBs also have applications in condensed matter (CM). Many
    pioneering CM experiments have already been performed at the ISOLDE facility
    (CERN). Continuing on this path at ISAC we have recently polarized a beam of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> to be used as a magnetic probe of ultra-thin
    films and interfaces. We report here on progress in developing this new
    application of low energy RIBs, which is based on the technique of
    β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR).

    We demonstrate that zero-field β-detected nuclear quadrupole resonance and
    spin relaxation of low energy <sup>8</sup>Li can be used as a sensitive
    local probe of structural phase transitions near a surface. We find that the
    transition near the surface of a SrTiO<sub>3</sub> single crystal occurs at
    <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> ~ 150 K, i.e., ~45 K higher than
    <i>T<sub>c</sub></i><sup>bulk</sup>, and that the tetragonal domains formed
    below <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> are randomly oriented.

    The temperature dependence of the frequency shift and spin-lattice
    relaxation rate of isolated, nonmagnetic <sup>8</sup>Li impurities implanted
    in a nearly ferromagnetic host (Pd) are measured by means of β-detected
    nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR). The shift is negative, very large, and
    increases monotonically with decreasing T in proportion to the bulk
    susceptibility of Pd for <i>T</i> > <i>T</i><sup>*</sup> ≈ 100 K. Below
    <i>T</i><sup>*</sup>, an additional shift occurs which we attribute to the
    response of Pd to the defect. The relaxation rate is much slower than
    expected for the large shift and is linear with <i>T</i> below
    <i>T</i><sup>*</sup>, showing no sign of additional relaxation mechanisms
    associated with the defect.

    Depth-controlled β-NMR was used to study highly spin-polarized
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in a Cu film of thickness 100 nm deposited onto a
    MgO substrate. The positive Knight shifts and spin relaxation data show that
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> occupies two sites at low temperatures, assigned
    to be the substitutional (<i>S</i>) and octahedral (<i>O</i>) interstitial
    sites. Between 50 and 150 K, there is a site change from <i>O</i> to
    <i>S</i>. The temperature dependence of the Knight shifts and spin-lattice
    relaxation rates at high temperatures, i.e., when all the Li are in the
    <i>S</i> site, is consistent with the Korringa law for a simple metal.

    A low energy radioactive beam of polarized <sup>8</sup>Li has been used to

    NbSe<sub>2</sub>. The inhomogeneous magnetic-field distribution associated
    with the vortex lattice was measured using depth-resolved β-detected NMR.
    Below <i>T<sub>c</sub></i>, one observes the characteristic line shape for a
    triangular vortex lattice which depends on the magnetic penetration depth
    and vortex core radius. The size of the vortex core varies strongly with the
    magnetic field. In particular, in a low field of 10.8 mT, the core radius is
    much larger than the coherence length. The possible origin of these giant
    vortices is discussed.

    The magnetic properties of a monolayer of Mn<sub>12</sub> single molecule
    magnets grafted onto a silicon (Si) substrate have been investigated using

    spin-polarized radioactive <sup>8</sup>Li was used to probe the local static
    magnetic field distribution near the Mn<sub>12</sub> monolayer in the Si
    substrate. The resonance line width varies strongly as a function of
    implantation depth as a result of the magnetic dipolar fields generated by
    the Mn<sub>12</sub> electronic magnetic moments. The temperature dependence
    of the line width indicates that the magnetic properties of the
    Mn<sub>12</sub> moments in this low-dimensional configuration differ from
    bulk Mn<sub>12</sub>.

    Low-energy β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance was used to investigate the
    spatial dependence of the hyperfine magnetic fields induced by Fe in the
    nonmagnetic Ag of an Au(40 Å)/Ag(200 Å)/Fe(140 Å) (001) magnetic multilayer
    grown on GaAs. The resonance line shape in the Ag layer shows dramatic
    broadening compared to that of intrinsic Ag. This broadening is attributed
    to large magnetic fields induced in this layer by the magnetic Fe layer. We
    find that the induced hyperfine field in the Ag follows a power law decay
    away from the Ag/Fe interface with power −1.93(8), and a field extrapolated
    to 0.23(5) T at the interface.

    We report the behavior of low energy <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted
    into gold as revealed by beta-detected NMR. At an external magnetic field of
    3 T, two narrow resonances are observed, which are attributed to Li in the
    octahedral interstitial and the substitutional lattice sites. The Knight
    shifts for these two resonances are found to be temperature independent with
    values of +141(4) and +73(5) ppm, respectively. The spin-lattice relaxation
    rate in high magnetic fields at 290 K is slow, consistent with the Korringa
    relation; however, the rate increases dramatically for magnetic fields below
    about 2 mT. We attribute this to interaction of the <sup>8</sup>Li spin with
    the host lattice nuclear spins.

    Low energy ion implantation of hyperpolarized radioactive magnetic resonance
    probes allows the NMR study of thin film heterostructures by enabling
    depth-resolved measurements on a nanometer lengthscale. By stopping the
    probe ions in a layer adjacent to a layer of interest, it is possible to
    study magnetic fields proximally. Here we show that, in the simplest case of
    a uniformly magnetized layer, this yields an unperturbed in situ frequency
    reference. We also discuss demagnetization contributions to measured shifts
    for this case. With a simple illustrative calculation, we show how a
    nonuniformly magnetized layer causes a strongly depth-dependent line
    broadening in an adjacent layer. We then give some experimental examples of
    resonance line broadening in heterostructures.

    A low energy beam of spin polarized 8Li has been used to investigate nuclear
    spin relaxation in the multiband superconductor NbSe<sub>2</sub>. In low
    magnetic fields there is significant cross relaxation between the
    <sup>8</sup>Li and the host <sup>93</sup>Nb spins, which is driven by low
    frequency fluctuations in the nuclear magnetic dipolar interaction. The rate
    of cross relaxation is strongly field dependent and thus the
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> spin relaxation rate of the <sup>8</sup>Li is a
    sensitive monitor of the static local magnetic field <i>B</i> just below the
    surface. This in turn is used to determine the absolute value of the
    magnetic penetration depth λ in the Meissner state. The temperature
    variations in 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and λ are consistent with a wide
    distribution of superconducting gaps expected for a multiband
    superconductor.

    We report results of beta-detected NMR of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>
    implanted in Nb at high magnetic field. We identify two distinct sites for
    <sup>8</sup>Li in the body-centered lattice. At low temperature, the site is
    characterized by a well-defined quadrupolar splitting. At about 50 K this
    site becomes unstable. Close to room temperature, Li occupies the cubic
    substitutional site. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements are consistent
    with a site-dependent coupling to the Nb conduction electrons and suggest
    that the site change proceeds in two steps. We report Knight shifts for the
    two well-defined sites and perform a Korringa analysis.

    the surface of the high-<i>T<sub>C</sub></i> superconductor
    YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-δ</sub> (YBCO). The magnetic-field
    distribution from the vortex lattice was detected by implanting a low-energy
    beam of highly polarized <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> into a thin overlayer of
    silver on optimally doped, twinned, and detwinned YBCO samples. The
    resonance in Ag broadens significantly below the transition temperature
    <i>T<sub>C</sub></i> as expected from the emerging field lines of the vortex
    lattice in YBCO. However, the lineshape is more symmetric and the dependence
    on the applied magnetic field is much weaker than expected from an ideal
    vortex lattice, indicating that the vortex density varies across the face of
    the sample, likely due to pinning at twin boundaries. At low temperatures
    the broadening from such disorder does not scale with the superfluid
    density.

    distribution in a silver film evaporated onto the superconductor shows
    additional line broadening, indicating the appearance of small disordered
    magnetic fields. The line broadening increases linearly with a weak external
    magnetic field applied parallel to the surface, and is depth independent up
    to 45 nm from the Ag/YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-δ</sub> interface.
    The magnitude of the line broadening extrapolated to zero applied field is
    less than 0.2 G, and is close to nuclear dipolar broadening in the Ag. This
    indicates that any fields due to broken time-reversal symmetry are less than
    0.2 G.

    A β-detected nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectrometer becomes a
    powerful tool to study changes in nuclear ground-state properties along
    isotopic chains when coupled to a laser excitation beamline to polarize the
    nuclei of interest. Recently, the β-NQR technique in a zero magnetic field
    has been applied for the first time to measure the ratio of static nuclear
    quadrupole moments of <sup>8,9</sup>Li, <i>Q</i><sub>9</sub>/<i>Q</i><sub>8</sub>
    = 0.96675(9) denoted by <i>Q</i><sub>8</sub> for <sup>8</sup>Li and
    <i>Q</i><sub>9</sub> for <sup>9</sup>Li, respectively. This shows agreement
    with present literature values but with significantly improved precision.
    Based on the literature, the quadrupole moment for <sup>8</sup>Li has been
    re-evaluated to be |<i>Q</i><sub>8</sub>| = 32.6(5) mb. From this, the
    quadrupole moment for <sup>9</sup>Li is calculated as |<i>Q</i><sub>9</sub>|
    = 31.5(5) mb with the error being dominated by the error of
    <i>Q</i><sub>8</sub>.

    We present an investigation of the near-surface tetragonal phase transition
    in SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, using the complementary techniques of beta-detected
    nuclear magnetic resonance and grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction. The
    results show a clear depth dependence of the phase transition on scales of a
    few microns. The measurements support a model in which there are tetragonal
    domains forming in the sample at temperatures much higher than the bulk
    phase transition temperature. Moreover, we find that these domains tend to
    form at higher temperatures preferentially near the free surface of the
    crystal. The details of the tetragonal domain formation and their
    depth/lateral dependencies are discussed.

    The magnetic properties of a 180-nm-thick epitaxial film of the dilute
    magnetic semiconductor Ga<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub> with x = 0.054 are
    investigated using beta-detected NMR of low-energy implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>. There is a broad distribution of local magnetic
    fields in the Ga<sub>1-x</sub>Mn<sub>x</sub> layer, reflecting the magnetic
    inhomogeneity of the system. The resonance (representing the local magnetic
    field distribution) is followed as a function of temperature through the
    ferromagnetic transition. The average hyperfine field at the <sup>8</sup>Li
    nucleus is measured to be positive and on the order of 150 G at low
    temperature, implying a negative hyperfine coupling of the <sup>8</sup>Li to
    the delocalized holes and suggesting that the holes are better described by
    an Mn-derived impurity band. The spin-lattice relaxation of <sup>8</sup>Li
    shows a remarkably weak feature at the phase transition and no Korringa
    behavior despite metallic conductivity. No evidence is found of the
    microscopic magnetic phase separation that has been suggested by some
    low-energy muon spin-rotation measurements.

    Level-crossing resonances are observed for spin-polarized <sup>8</sup>Li in
    copper at 200 K. The positions of the resonances as a function of magnetic
    field and crystal orientation are a precise measure of the induced
    quadrupolar interaction on the nearest-neighbor Cu spins and provide
    unambiguous evidence that <sup>8</sup>Li occupies a substitutional site. The
    resonances are detected as enhancements in the <sup>8</sup>Li spin
    relaxation rate and are much broader than predicted from a static spin
    Hamiltonian. A strong collision model is used to extract a decoherence time
    as a result of the dipolar coupling of the <sup>8</sup>Li-Cu subsystem to
    the surrounding nuclear spin bath.

    We report β-NMR investigations of polarized <sup>8</sup>Li implanted in thin
    Pb and Ag/Nb films. At the critical superconducting temperature, we observe
    a singular peak in the spin relaxation rate in small longitudinal magnetic
    fields, which is attributed to unexpected slow fluctuations in the
    superconducting order parameter. The peak is several orders of magnitude
    larger than the prediction based on the enhancement of the dynamic electron
    spin susceptibility by superconducting fluctuations. The observed peak in
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> is rapidly suppressed in a small magnetic field,
    indicating that it is due to remarkably slow diamagnetic fluctuations which
    are undetectable with conventional NMR.

    We report β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) measurements of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted into high purity Pt. The frequency of
    the <sup>8</sup>Li β-NMR resonance and the spin-lattice relaxation rates
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> were measured at temperatures ranging from 3 to 300
    K. Remarkably, both the spin-lattice relaxation rate and the Knight shift
    <i>K</i> depend linearly on temperature <i>T</i> although the bulk
    susceptibility does not. <i>K</i> is found to scale with the Curie-Weiss
    dependence of the Pt susceptibility extrapolated to low temperatures. This
    is attributed to a defect response of the enhanced paramagnetism of Pt,
    i.e., the presence of the interstitial Li<sup>+</sup> locally relieves the
    tendency for the Curie-Weiss susceptibility to saturate at low <i>T</i>. We
    propose that the low temperature saturation in <i>χ</i> of Pt may be related
    to an interband coupling between the <i>s</i> and <i>d</i> bands that is
    disrupted locally by the presence of the Li<sup>+</sup>.

    We report the observation of weak magnetism in superlattices of
    LaAlO<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> using β-detected nuclear magnetic
    resonance. The spin lattice relaxation rate of <sup>8</sup>Li in
    superlattices with a spacer layers of 8 and 6 unit cells of
    LaAlO<sub>3</sub> exhibits a strong peak near ~35 K, whereas no such peak is
    observed in a superlattice with spacer layer thickness of 3 unit cells. We
    attribute the observed temperature dependence to slowing down of weakly
    coupled electronic moments at the LaAlO<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
    interface. These results show that the magnetism at the interface depends
    strongly on the thickness of the spacer layer, and that a minimal thickness
    of ~4-6 unit cells is required for the appearance of magnetism. A simple
    model is used to determine that the observed relaxation is due to small
    fluctuating moments (~0.002 μ<sub>B</sub>) in the two samples with a larger
    LaAlO<sub>3</sub> spacer thickness.

    fundamental properties of nuclei, nuclear astrophysics, medical physics,

    is on the latter subject and in particular recent developments in the use of
    β-detected NMR to probe electronic, magnetic, and structural properties of
    thin films and interfaces. Over the last 10 years considerable progress has
    been made developing the technique and applying it to current problems.

    We have measured the NMR of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted in a set of
    thin epitaxial films of Pd. We find a large, negative, strongly
    temperature-dependent Knight shift <i>K</i> consistent with previous
    measurements on polycrystalline films. The temperature dependence of the
    shift exhibits a characteristic deviation from the susceptibility
    <i>χ</i>(<i>T</i>). In particular, at low temperature, <i>K</i>(<i>T</i>)
    continues to follow a simple Curie-Weiss dependence. This result provides
    important insight into the origin of the low-temperature behavior of
    <i>χ</i>(<i>T</i>) in strongly paramagnetic metals. In addition, we find the
    room temperature shift depends on film thickness, with changes on the order
    of 20 % between films 100 nm and 30 nm thick. We also observe a
    surface-related resonance in both Au-capped and uncapped films with a small
    positive shift. These features bear a striking similarity to the Pt NMR line
    shapes in much smaller Pt particles. However, they seem to originate, not
    from adsorbed species, but rather in confinement effects on the highly
    exhange-enhanced Pd <i>d</i> band.

    The ratio of electric quadrupole moments of <sup>11</sup>Li and

    quadrupole resonance technique at TRIUMF-ISAC. The precision on the ratio
    <i>Q</i><sub>11</sub>/<i>Q</i><sub>9</sub> = 1.0775(12) was improved by more
    than one order of magnitude and an absolute value for the quadrupole moment
    of <sup>11</sup>Li was inferred. Systematic effects, as argued here, are not
    expected to contribute to the ratio on this scale. The zero-field
    spin-lattice relaxation time for <sup>8</sup>Li implanted within
    SrTiO<sub>3</sub> at 295 K in zero-field was found to be
    <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> = 1.73(2) s. A comparison of the quadrupole moments of
    <sup>9,11</sup>Li and their ratio is made with the latest models, however,
    no conclusion may yet be drawn owing to the size of the theoretical
    uncertainties.

    β-Detected nuclear spin relaxation of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> has been
    used to study the microscopic diffusion of lithium ions in thin films of
    poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), where the implanted lithium ions are present in
    extremely low concentration, and PEO with 30 wt %
    LiCF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> over a wide range of temperatures both above
    and below the glass transition temperature. Recent measurements by Do et al.
    [<i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</i> <b>2013</b>, 111, 018301] found that the
    temperature dependence of the Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity was identical to
    that of the dielectric α relaxation and was well described by the
    Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann relation, implying the α relaxation dominates the
    Li<sup>+</sup> transport process. In contrast, we find the hopping of
    Li<sup>+</sup> in both samples in the high temperature viscoelastic phase
    follows an Arrhenius law and depends significantly on the salt content. We
    propose that the hopping of Li<sup>+</sup> between cages involves motion of
    the polymer but that it is only for long-range diffusion where the α
    relaxation plays an important role.

    The β-NMR facility at ISAC is constructed specifically for experiments in
    condensed matter physics with radioactive ion beams. Using co-linear optical
    pumping, a <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> ion beam having a large nuclear spin
    polarisation and low energy (nominally 30 keV) can be generated. When
    implanted into materials these ions penetrate to shallow depths comparable
    to length scales of interest in the physics of surfaces and interfaces
    between materials. Such low-energy ions can be decelerated with simple
    electrostatic optics to enable depth-resolved studies of near-surface
    phenomena over the range of about 2-200 nm. Since the β-NMR signal is
    extracted from the asymmetry intrinsic to beta-decay and therefore monitors
    the polarisation of the radioactive probe nuclear magnetic moments, this
    technique is fundamentally a probe of local magnetism. More generally
    though, any phenomena which affects the polarisation of the implanted spins
    by, for example, a change in resonance frequency, line width or relaxation
    rate can be studied. The β-NMR program at ISAC currently supports a number
    of experiments in magnetism and superconductivity as well as novel
    ultra-thin heterostructures exhibiting properties that cannot occur in bulk
    materials. The general purpose zero/low field and high field spectrometers
    are configured to perform CW and pulsed RF nuclear magnetic resonance and
    spin relaxation experiments over a range of temperatures (3-300 K) and
    magnetic fields (0-9 T).

    We report the NMR Knight shift and spin-lattice relaxation of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted ~100 nm into single crystals of
    semimetallic Sb, Bi, and topologically insulating
    Bi<sub>0.9</sub>Sb<sub>0.1</sub>. We find small negative shifts (of order
    100 ppm) in all three. In the insulator, the shift is nearly temperature
    independent, while in Bi and Sb it becomes more negative at low temperature
    without following the bulk susceptibility, suggesting two distinct
    temperature dependent contributions, possibly from the orbital and spin
    response. However, a simple model is unable to account for the observed
    shift. The spin-lattice relaxation differs in both scale and temperature
    dependence in all three. It is Korringa-like in Bi and remarkably is fastest
    in the insulating alloy and slowest in Sb with the highest bulk carrier
    density. These surprising results call for detailed calculations, but
    phenomenologically demonstrate that β-detected NMR of implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> is sensitive to the magnetic response of
    low-density carriers. The prospects for depth-resolved studies of
    conventional and topological surface states at lower implantation energies
    are good.

    β-detected nuclear spin relaxation of <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> has been
    used to probe the depth dependence of molecular dynamics in high- and
    low-molecular-weight deuterated polystyrene. The average nuclear
    spin-lattice relaxation rate, 1/<i>T</i><sup>avg</sup><sub>1</sub>, is a
    measure of the spectral density of the polymer motion at the Larmor
    frequency (41 MHz at 6.55 T). In both samples,
    1/<i>T</i><sup>avg</sup><sub>1</sub> is depth independent below ~200 K but
    above this temperature it decreases approximately exponentially with
    distance from the free surface, returning to bulk behavior for depths
    greater than ~10 nm. This is direct evidence for a region near the free
    surface with enhanced molecular dynamics compared with the bulk. The
    effective thickness of the surface region increases with increasing
    temperature and is finite even above the glass transition. These results
    present challenges for the current understanding of dynamics near the
    surface of polymer glasses.

    NMR detected by radioactive beta decay, β-NMR, is undergoing a renaissance
    largely due to the availability of high intensity low energy beams of the
    most common probe ion, <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>, and dedicated facilities
    for materials research. The radioactive detection scheme, combined with the
    low energy ion beam, enable depth resolved NMR measurements in crystals,
    thin films and multilayers on depth scales of 2-200 nm. After a brief
    historical introduction, technical aspects of implanted-ion β-NMR are
    presented, followed by a review of recent applications to a wide range of
    solids.

    A β-NMR study was performed on a Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> crystal in
    the metallic state using a beam of spin-polarized <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>
    implanted at a mean depth of 90 nm. The <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>
    spin-lattice relaxation rate is strongly influenced by the onset of
    incommensurate spin fluctuations. The nuclear relaxation rate can be
    explained using previously published bulk <sup>17</sup>O NMR and inelastic
    neutron spectroscopy measurements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility to
    model the hyperfine coupling. A well-resolved quadrupolar-split NMR for
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implies a static stopping position in an
    interstitial site. The <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> Knight shift is highly
    sensitive to the anisotropic static susceptibility.

    Considerable evidence suggests that variations in the properties of
    topological insulators (TIs) at the nanoscale and at interfaces can strongly
    affect the physics of topological materials. Therefore, a detailed
    understanding of surface states and interface coupling is crucial to the
    search for and applications of new topological phases of matter. Currently,
    no methods can provide depth profiling near surfaces or at interfaces of
    topologically inequivalent materials. Such a method could advance the study
    of interactions. Herein, we present a noninvasive depth-profiling technique
    based on β-detected NMR (β-NMR) spectroscopy of radioactive
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> ions that can provide "one-dimensional imaging"
    in films of fixed thickness and generates nanoscale views of the electronic
    wavefunctions and magnetic order at topological surfaces and interfaces. By
    mapping the <sup>8</sup>Li nuclear resonance near the surface and 10-nm deep
    into the bulk of pure and Cr-doped bismuth antimony telluride films, we
    provide signatures related to the TI properties and their topological
    nontrivial characteristics that affect the electron-nuclear hyperfine field,
    the metallic shift, and magnetic order. These nanoscale variations in β-NMR
    parameters reflect the unconventional properties of the topological
    materials under study, and understanding the role of heterogeneities is
    expected to lead to the discovery of novel phenomena involving quantum
    materials.

    We present β-detected NMR measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted into an epitaxial heterostructure based
    on a 100 nm thick film of ferromagnetic (FM) EuO as a function of
    temperature through its FM transition. In the FM state, the spin-lattice
    relaxation rate follows the same temperature dependence, determined by
    magnon scattering mechanisms, observed in the bulk by <sup>153</sup>Eu NMR,
    but above 40 K, the signal is wiped out. We also find that
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> stopped in material adjacent to the magnetic
    layer exhibits spin relaxation related to the critical slowing of the Eu
    spins. A particularly strong relaxation in the Au overlayer suggests an
    unusual strong nonlocal coupling mechanism to <sup>8</sup>Li in the metal.

    By measuring the prototypical antiferromagnet α−Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
    we show that it is possible to determine the static spin orientation and
    dynamic spin correlations within nanometers from an antiferromagnetic
    surface using the nuclear spin polarization of implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> ions detected with β-NMR. Remarkably, the
    first-order Morin spin reorientation in single crystal
    α−Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> occurs at the same temperature at all depths
    between 1 and 100 nm from the (110) surface; however, the implanted nuclear
    spin experiences an increased 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> relaxation rate at
    shallow depths revealing soft-surface magnons. The surface-localized
    dynamics decay towards the bulk with a characteristic length of <i>ε</i> =
    11 ± 1  nm, closely matching the finite-size thresholds of hematite
    nanostructures.

    β-detected NMR (β-NMR) has been used to study the molecular-scale dynamics
    of lithium ions in thin films of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) containing
    either lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) or lithium
    trifluoroacetate (LiTFA) salts at monomer-to-salt ratios (EO/Li) of 8.3. The
    results are compared with previous β-NMR measurements on pure PEO and PEO
    with lithium triflate (LiOTf) at the same loading [McKenzie et al., J. Am.
    Chem. Soc. <b>136</b>, 7833 (2014)]. Activated hopping of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> was observed in all of the films above ~250 K,
    with the hopping parameters strongly correlated with the ionicity of the
    lithium salt rather than the polymer glass transition temperature. The
    pre-exponential factor increases exponentially with ionicity, while the
    activation energy for hopping increases approximately linearly, going from
    6.3 ± 0.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> in PEO:LiTFA to 17.8 ± 0.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>
    in PEO:LiTFSI. The more rapid increase in the pre-exponential factor
    outweighs the effect of the larger activation energy and results in
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> hopping being fastest in PEO followed by
    PEO:LiTFSI, PEO:LiOTf, and PEO:LiTFA.

    Diffusion of Li<sup>+</sup> in (111) oriented thin films of the spinels
    Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> and LiTi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
    has been studied with <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected NMR in the temperature range
    between 5 and 310 K. In Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, the
    spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>) versus temperature
    shows a clear maximum around 100 K (= <i>T</i><sub>max</sub>) which we
    attribute to magnetic freezing of dilute Ti<sup>3+</sup> local magnetic
    moments, consistent with the results of magnetization and muon spin
    relaxation (μ<sup>+</sup>SR) measurements. The decrease in
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> with temperature above <i>T</i><sub>max</sub>
    indicates that Li<sup>+</sup> starts to diffuse with a thermal activation
    energy (<i>E<sub>a</sub></i>) of 0.11(1) eV. In
    LiTi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, on the contrary, as temperature increases
    from 200 K, 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> increases monotonically up to 310 K. This
    suggests that Li also starts to diffuse above 200 K with
    <i>E<sub>a</sub></i> = 0.16(2) eV in LiTi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.
    Comparison with conventional Li-NMR on
    Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> implies that both β-NMR and
    μ<sup>+</sup>SR sense short-range Li motion, i.e., a jump diffusion of
    Li<sup>+</sup> to the nearest neighboring sites.

    We report measurements of the dynamics of isolated
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in single crystal rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> using
    β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance. From spin-lattice relaxation and
    motional narrowing, we find two sets of thermally activated dynamics: one
    below 100 K and one at higher temperatures. At low temperature, the
    activation barrier is 26.8(6) meV with prefactor 1.23(5) × 10<sup>10</sup>
    s<sup>-1</sup>. We suggest this is unrelated to Li<sup>+</sup> motion and
    rather is a consequence of electron polarons in the vicinity of the
    implanted <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> that are known to become mobile in this
    temperature range. Above 100 K, Li<sup>+</sup> undergoes long-range
    diffusion as an isolated uncomplexed cation, characterized by an activation
    energy and prefactor of 0.32(2) eV and 1.0(5) × 10<sup>16</sup>
    s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, in agreement with macroscopic diffusion
    measurements. These results in the dilute limit from a microscopic probe
    indicate that Li<sup>+</sup> concentration does not limit the diffusivity
    even up to high concentrations but that some key ingredient is missing in
    the calculations of the migration barrier. The anomalous prefactors provide
    further insight into both Li<sup>+</sup> and polaron motion.

    There is indirect evidence that the dynamics of a polymer near a free
    surface are enhanced compared with the bulk but there are few studies of how
    dynamics varies with depth. β-Detected nuclear spin relaxation of implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> has been used to directly probe the temperature
    and depth dependence of the γ-relaxation mode, which is due to phenyl rings
    undergoing restricted rotation, in thin films of atactic deuterated
    polystyrene (PS-d8) and determine how the depth dependence of dynamics is
    affected by sample processing, such as annealing, floating on water and the
    inclusion of a surfactant, and by the presence of a buried interface. The
    activation energy for the γ-relaxation process is lower near the free
    surface. Annealing the PS-d8 films and then immersing in water to mimic the
    floating procedure used to transfer films had negligible effects on the
    thickness of the region near the free surface with enhanced mobility.
    Measurements on a bilayer film indicate enhanced phenyl ring dynamics near
    the buried interface compared with a single film at the same depth. PS-d8
    films annealed with the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) deposited on
    the surface show enhanced dynamics in the bulk compared with a pure PS-d8
    film and a PS-d8 film where the SDS was washed away. There is less contrast
    between the surface and bulk in the SDS-treated sample, which could account
    for the elimination of the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> confinement effect observed
    in films containing SDS [Chen and Torkelson, <i>Polymer</i>, 2016,
    <b>87</b>, 226].

    We report measurements on the high-temperature ionic and low-temperature
    electronic properties of the three-dimensional topological insulator
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>2</sub>Se using ion-implanted <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected
    nuclear magnetic relaxation and resonance. With implantation energies in the
    range 5-28 keV, the probes penetrate beyond the expected range of the
    topological surface state, but are still within 250 nm of the surface. At
    temperatures above ~150K, spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal
    isolated <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion with an activation energy
    <i>E<sub>A</sub></i> = 0.185(8) eV and attempt frequency
    <i>τ</i><sub>0</sub><sup>−1</sup> = 8 ± 3 × 10<sup>11</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>
    for atomic site-to-site hopping. At lower temperature, we find a linear
    Korringa-type relaxation mechanism with a field-dependent slope and
    intercept, which is accompanied by an anomalous field dependence to the
    resonance shift. We suggest that these may be related to a strong
    contribution from orbital currents or the magnetic freeze-out of charge
    carriers in this heavily compensated semiconductor, but that conventional
    theories are unable to account for the extent of the field dependence.
    Conventional NMR of the stable host nuclei may help elucidate their origin.

    We report measurements of the diffusion rate of isolated ion-implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> within ~120  nm of the surface of oriented
    single-crystal rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> using a radiotracer technique. The α
    particles from the <sup>8</sup>Li decay provide a sensitive monitor of the
    distance from the surface and how the depth profile of <sup>8</sup>Li
    evolves with time. The main findings are that the implanted Li<sup>+</sup>
    diffuses and traps at the (001) surface. The <i>T</i> dependence of the
    diffusivity is described by a bi-Arrhenius expression with activation
    energies of 0.3341(21) eV above 200 K, whereas at lower temperatures it has
    a much smaller barrier of 0.0313(15) eV. We consider possible origins for
    the surface trapping, as well the nature of the low-<i>T</i> barrier.

    We report β-detected NMR of ion-implanted <sup>8</sup>Li in a single crystal
    and thin film of the strongly correlated metal LaNiO<sub>3</sub>.
    Spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal two distinct local environments,
    both metallic as evident from <i>T</i>-linear Korringa
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> below 200 K with slopes comparable to other metals. A
    small approximately temperature-independent Knight shift of ~74 ppm is
    observed, yielding a normalized Korringa product characteristic of
    substantial antiferromagnetic correlations. We find no evidence for a
    magnetic transition from 4 to 310 K. The similarity of these features in the
    two very different samples indicates that they are intrinsic and unrelated
    to dilute oxygen vacancies. We attribute the two environments to two
    distinct but similar crystallographic <sup>8</sup>Li sites and not to any
    form of phase inhomogeneity, but this is inconsistent with the conventional
    rhombohedral structure of LaNiO<sub>3</sub>, and also cannot be simply
    explained by the common alternative orthorhombic or monoclinic distortions.

    We demonstrate the application of implanted-ion β-detected NMR as a probe of
    ionic liquid molecular dynamics through the measurement of <sup>8</sup>Li
    spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) and resonance in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
    acetate. The motional narrowing of the resonance and the local maxima in the
    SLR rate, 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, imply sensitivity to subnanosecond
    Li<sup>+</sup> solvation dynamics. From an analysis of
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, we extract an activation energy <i>E<sub>A</sub></i>
    = 74.8(1.5) meV and Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann constant <i>T</i><sub>VFT</sub> =
    165.8(0.9) K, in agreement with the dynamic viscosity of the bulk solvent.
    Near the melting point, the lineshape is broad and intense, and the form of
    the relaxation is nonexponential, reflective of our sensitivity to
    heterogeneous dynamics near the glass transition. The depth resolution of
    this technique may later provide a unique means of studying nanoscale
    phenomena in ionic liquids.

    We have studied a mosaic of 1T-CrSe<sub>2</sub> single crystals using
    β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance of <sup>8</sup>Li from 4 to 300 K. We
    identify two broad resonances that show no evidence of quadrupolar
    splitting, indicating two magnetically distinct environments for the
    implanted ion. We observe stretched exponential spin lattice relaxation and
    a corresponding rate (1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>) that increases monotonically
    above 200 K, consistent with the onset of ionic diffusion. A pronounced
    maximum in 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> is observed at the low temperature
    magnetic transition near 20 K. Between these limits, 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>
    exhibits a broad minimum with an anomalous absence of strong features in the
    vicinity of structural and magnetic transitions between 150 and 200 K.
    Together, the results suggest <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> site occupation
    within the van der Waals gap between CrSe<sub>2</sub> trilayers. Possible
    origins of the two environments are discussed.
