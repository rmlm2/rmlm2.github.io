  abstract: >-
    It has long been desirable to develop a spin-1/2 nucleus as a probe for
    β-detected NMR studies of solid materials. As a pure magnetic probe, it
    would greatly compliment our most extensively used nucleus <sup>8</sup>Li
    (spin-2), which is sensitive to both dipolar and quadrupolar interactions.
    Following the recent successful polarization of spin-1/2 <sup>31</sup>Mg at
    TRIUMF, we report here on its use to study solids where host magnesium atoms
    occupy lattice sites with cubic symmetry - a situation most directly
    comparable to (stable) <sup>25</sup>Mg NMR. We show preliminary results in:
    rocksalt MgO; spinel MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>; and antifluorite
    Mg<sub>2</sub>Si, which is an interesting semiconducting thermoelectric.
    Deviations from the results with conventional <sup>25</sup>Mg NMR are
    attributed to the systematics associated with the β-NMR technique. The
    <sup>31</sup>Mg decay chain is found to complicate the extraction of
    spin-lattice relaxation rates due to a time-dependent background signal
    introduced by its progeny. The prospect of further use of 31Mg as a β-NMR
    probe for the study of condensed matter is good.
