    Low temperature growth methods were used to encapsulate a buried Mn δ-doping
    layer into a silicon host. A β-NMR investigation was performed of the
    magnetic properties in the temperature range 10-300 K using spin-polarized
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>. A depth-dependent broadening and shift of the
    NMR resonance was detected that is consistent with internal fields
    distributed at depths of 10-30 nm beneath the surface. At low temperatures,
    a negative relative shift occurred and the resonance was significantly
    broadened. At 300 K the line-shape could be described by a single Gaussian
    line, however, at 10 K the line is best approximated by a two component
    Lorentzian shape consisting of a broad and narrow component as anticipated
    for a diluted magnetic alloy. The overall magnitude of the resonance shift
    at both temperatures is small suggesting a weak interaction between the
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> and the magnetic Mn environment.

    We report preliminary low-energy β-NMR measurements of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted in single crystal rutile
    TiO<sub>2</sub> at an applied field of 6.55 T and 300 K. We observe a broad
    12 kHz wide quadrupole split resonance with unresolved features and a sharp
    component at the Larmor frequency. The line broadening may be caused by
    overlapping multi-quantum transitions or motion of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> on the scale of its lifetime (1.21 s). We also
    find spin-lattice relaxation that is relatively fast compared to other wide
    band gap insulators. The origin of this fast relaxation is also likely
    quadrupolar and may be due to anisotropic <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>
    diffusion.

    We present extensive high magnetic field β-NMR measurements of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted in single crystals of MgO. The narrow
    resonance, consistent with a cubic <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> site, likely
    the tetrahedral interstitital, is used routinely as a reference for shift
    measurements. We show the intrinsic linewidth is on the order of 200 Hz,
    allowing a frequency determination to an accuracy of a few Hz. We find no
    implantation energy dependence of the resonance within a few ppm, but there
    is evidence of slow spin dynamics in hole-burning measurements. The spin
    lattice relaxation is slow. The temperature dependence reveals interesting
    changes at low temperature whose origin remains uncertain.

    A 28 keV beam of <sup>31</sup>Mg<sup>+</sup> ions was extracted from a
    uranium carbide, proton-beam-irradiated target coupled to a laser ion
    source. The ion beam was nuclear-spin polarized by collinear optical pumping
    on the <sup>2</sup><i>S</i><sub>1/2</sub>-<sup>2</sup><i>P</i><sub>1/2</sub>
    transition at 280 nm. The polarization was preserved by an extended 1 mT
    guide field as the beam was transported via electrostatic bends into a 2.5 T
    longitudinal magnetic field. There the beam was implanted into a single
    crystal MgO target and the beta decay asymmetry was measured. Both hyperfine
    ground states were optically pumped with a single frequency light source,
    using segmentation of the beam energy, which boosted the polarization by
    approximately 50 % compared to pumping a single ground state. The total
    decay asymmetry of 0.06 and beam intensity were sufficient to provide a
    useful spin-1/2 beam for future BNMR experiments. A variant of the method
    was used previously to optically pump the full Doppler-broadened absorption
    profile of a beam of <sup>11</sup>Be<sup>+</sup> with a single-frequency
    light source.

    The span of most chemical shifts recorded in conventional
    <sup>25</sup>Mg-NMR spectroscopy is ~100 ppm. Accordingly, linewidths of ~10
    ppm or better are desirable to achieve adequate resolution for applications
    in chemistry. Here we present first high-field <sup>31</sup>Mg-β-NMR
    measurements of <sup>31</sup>Mg<sup>+</sup> ions implanted into a MgO single
    crystal carried out at the ISAC facility at TRIUMF. The resonances recorded
    at 2.5 T and 3.5 T show strong linewidth dependency on the applied RF power,
    ranging from ~419 ppm for the highest RF power down to ~48 ppm for the
    lowest one.

    Here we report the temperature and applied magnetic field dependence of the
    spin lattice relaxation of implanted into Au foil in the range 4 to 290 K
    and 3 to 150 G. Below about 50 G, relaxation due to the dynamic host lattice
    nuclear spins is important, becoming dominant below 20 G. At 150 G, this
    process is quenched, and the relaxation is Korringa-like. We report the
    first measurement of its temperature dependence which shows the
    characteristic features of the site change around 190 K. At lower field the
    relaxation is two component above 100 K and exhibits a strong peak at the
    site change, which we attribute to quadrupolar relaxation of the adjacent Au
    spins. We discuss the ingredients required for a quantitative theory of the
    low field relaxation.

    It is widely believed that a space-charge layer (SCL) exists at the vicinity
    of a boundary between a solid electrolyte layer and electrode layer in an
    all solid-state Li-ion battery due to the difference of their chemical
    potentials, although there are no direct experimental evidences. Here, the
    Li concentration is predicted to decrease drastically in the SCL. In order
    to clarify whether SCL exists or not, we have attempted to measure the
    <sup>8</sup>Li β-NMR spectrum for a multilayer sample, MgO (50
     nm)/Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (70  nm)/LiCoO<sub>2</sub> (200  nm) as a
    function of implanted energy of <sup>8</sup>Li. The resonance spectrum was
    fitted by a combination of two Lorentzians and one background signal.
    Furthermore, the line width of the resonance signal from the
    Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> layer is found to become broad towards the
    boundary with the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> layer. This is consistent with the
    presence of an SCL.

    We report <sup>8</sup>Li spin lattice relaxation in two forms of the
    molecular glass TPD, one a normal glass and one prepared in an ultrastable
    configuration. The relaxation is remarkably fast, similar to <sup>8</sup>Li
    relaxation in other organic materials and shows a stretched exponential
    behavior typical of glasses with a small stretching exponent β = 0.3. At low
    temperature, there is little or no difference between the two glasses, while
    above 250 K, the relaxation in the denser ultrastable form is faster. In
    addition, in this temperature range, the data shows a significant thermal
    hysteresis.

    Using 8Li β-NMR we studied the temperature dependence of the spin–lattice
    relaxation in LaAlO<sub>3</sub> in high magnetic field. The relaxation in
    LAO is composed of two components: a fast-relaxing signal with a small
    amplitude, and a large amplitude, slow relaxing component. The data was fit
    using a highly-constrained model which assumes that the temperature
    dependence of the slow and fast component is the same at all temperatures.
    The <sup>8</sup>Li relaxation suggests a <i>T</i><sup>2</sup> temperature
    dependence, indicating that the relaxation mechanism could be due to a
    coupling between the quadrupole moment of <sup>8</sup>Li and the soft-mode,
    low energy phonons in LAO.

    Using <sup>8</sup>Li β-NMR we studied two cation substituted solid
    solutions: yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O<sub>3</sub>
    (LSAT). LSAT showed well defined but highly broadened quadrupolar
    satellites, with a similar pattern to that observed in SrTiO<sub>3</sub>. In
    contrast, the resonance in YSZ showed a single, broad peak indicative of a
    cubic <sup>8</sup>Li implantation site. The <sup>8</sup>Li spin–lattice
    relaxation at 6.55 T, for both solid solutions, is very slow; while at
    150 G, the relaxation in LSAT becomes faster due to the <sup>27</sup>Al
    nuclear moments similar to Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. For YSZ the low
    field relaxation rate is also relatively fast possibly due to mobile
    O<sup>2-</sup> anions.

    of temperature and crystal orientation with respect to an applied magnetic
    field. The observed frequency splittings are consistent with dipolar fields
    from the paramagnetic U<sup>3+</sup> moments and an anisotropic hyperfine
    interaction with the muons stopping midway on the edges of the cubic uranium
    sublattice. The disappearance of the splittings above 180 K is attributed to
    rapid muon diffusion. We find no evidence of a spin polaron bound to the
    muon in UBe<sub>13</sub>.

    It has long been desirable to develop a spin-1/2 nucleus as a probe for
    β-detected NMR studies of solid materials. As a pure magnetic probe, it
    would greatly compliment our most extensively used nucleus <sup>8</sup>Li
    (spin-2), which is sensitive to both dipolar and quadrupolar interactions.
    Following the recent successful polarization of spin-1/2 <sup>31</sup>Mg at
    TRIUMF, we report here on its use to study solids where host magnesium atoms
    occupy lattice sites with cubic symmetry - a situation most directly
    comparable to (stable) <sup>25</sup>Mg NMR. We show preliminary results in:
    rocksalt MgO; spinel MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>; and antifluorite
    Mg<sub>2</sub>Si, which is an interesting semiconducting thermoelectric.
    Deviations from the results with conventional <sup>25</sup>Mg NMR are
    attributed to the systematics associated with the β-NMR technique. The
    <sup>31</sup>Mg decay chain is found to complicate the extraction of
    spin-lattice relaxation rates due to a time-dependent background signal
    introduced by its progeny. The prospect of further use of 31Mg as a β-NMR
    probe for the study of condensed matter is good.

    We demonstrate that the ratio of 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> spin–lattice
    relaxation rates (SLR) of two different isotopes (here <sup>8</sup>Li and
    <sup>9</sup>Li) can be used in order to identify the predominant relaxation
    mechanism within the β-NMR technique. We studied with both isotopes a Pt
    foil and two samples of single crystal SrTiO<sub>3</sub>. In Pt, the ratio
    of the SLR rates was 6.82(29), which is close to but less than the
    theoretical limit of ~7.68 for pure magnetic relaxation. In
    SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, the weighted averaged SLR ratio of the two samples was
    2.7(3), which is close but larger than the theoretical limit of ~2.14
    expected for pure electric quadrupolar relaxation. This indicates that the
    primary source of relaxation in SrTiO<sub>3</sub> is electric quadrupolar in
    origin and that magnetic effects have a much smaller importance in this
    material. The low effective asymmetry of <sup>9</sup>Li was the dominant
    cause of uncertainty of the measurements in this study. We propose a system
    of tagging the beta-decays in coincidence with the alpha decays that take
    place in two of the three primary decay channels of <sup>9</sup>Li as a way
    of increasing the effective asymmetry and enhance the signal of
    <sup>9</sup>Li β-NMR.
