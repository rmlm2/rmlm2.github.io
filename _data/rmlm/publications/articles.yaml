    Free radical addition to alkenes is an important aspect of radical mediated
    polymerization reactions. In this work, we investigated free radical
    addition to vinylidene fluoride (VDF) in supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>
    (scCO<sub>2</sub>). scCO<sub>2</sub> is an important "green solvent" and
    polymerization is one of the most important applications of this solvent.
    Our results suggest a clear selectivity among different free radical
    reaction channels for reaction of H atom with VDF. In particular the
    preferred reaction channel in the temperature range of 280 to 420 K and
    density range of 0.1 to 0.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup> is the addition to the
    CH<sub>2</sub> side.

    We report rate constants for muonium addition to 1,1-difluoroethylene
    (vinylidene fluoride) in CO<sub>2</sub> at 290-530 K, 40-360 bar, and
    0.05-0.90 g cm<sup>-3</sup>. Rate constants are mapped against their
    thermodynamic conditions, demonstrating the kinetic tuning ability of the
    solvent. The reaction exhibits critical slowing near conditions of maximum
    solvent isothermal compressibility, where activation volumes of
    unprecedentedly large magnitudes on the order of ±10<sup>6</sup>
    cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> are observed. Such values are suggestive of
    pressure being a significant parameter for tuning fluorolkene reactivity.

    We report herein a means to modify the reactivity of alkenes, and
    particularly to modify their selectivity toward reactions with nonpolar
    reactants (e.g., nonpolar free radicals) in supercritical carbon dioxide
    near the critical point. Rate constants for free radical addition of the
    light hydrogen isotope muonium to ethylene, vinylidene fluoride, and
    vinylidene chloride in supercritical carbon dioxide are compared over a
    range of pressures and temperatures. Near carbon dioxide’s critical point,
    the addition to ethylene exhibits critical speeding up, while the
    halogenated analogues display critical slowing. This suggests that
    supercritical carbon dioxide as a solvent may be used to tune alkene
    chemistry in near-critical conditions.

    A β-NMR study was performed on a Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> crystal in
    the metallic state using a beam of spin-polarized <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>
    implanted at a mean depth of 90 nm. The <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>
    spin-lattice relaxation rate is strongly influenced by the onset of
    incommensurate spin fluctuations. The nuclear relaxation rate can be
    explained using previously published bulk <sup>17</sup>O NMR and inelastic
    neutron spectroscopy measurements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility to
    model the hyperfine coupling. A well-resolved quadrupolar-split NMR for
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implies a static stopping position in an
    interstitial site. The <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> Knight shift is highly
    sensitive to the anisotropic static susceptibility.

    By measuring the prototypical antiferromagnet α−Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
    we show that it is possible to determine the static spin orientation and
    dynamic spin correlations within nanometers from an antiferromagnetic
    surface using the nuclear spin polarization of implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> ions detected with β-NMR. Remarkably, the
    first-order Morin spin reorientation in single crystal
    α−Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> occurs at the same temperature at all depths
    between 1 and 100 nm from the (110) surface; however, the implanted nuclear
    spin experiences an increased 1/T1 relaxation rate at shallow depths
    revealing soft-surface magnons. The surface-localized dynamics decay towards
    the bulk with a characteristic length of ε=11±1  nm, closely matching the
    finite-size thresholds of hematite nanostructures.

    Chemisorption of muonium onto the surface of gold nanoparticles has been
    observed. Muonium (μ<sup>+</sup>e<sup>-</sup>), a light hydrogen-like atom,
    reacts chemically with uncapped 7 nm gold nanoparticles embedded in
    mesoporous silica (SBA-15) with a strong temperature-dependent rate. The
    addition rate is fast enough to allow coherent spin transfer into a
    diamagnetic muon state on the nanoparticle surface. The muon is well
    established as a sensitive probe of static or slowly fluctuating magnetic
    fields in bulk matter. These results represent the first muon spin rotation
    signal on a nanoparticle surface or any metallic surface. Only weak magnetic
    effects are seen on the surface of these Au nanoparticles consistent with
    Pauli paramagnetism.

    β-NMR measurements of molecular-scale lithium-ion dynamics in poly(ethylene

    β-detected NMR (β-NMR) has been used to study the molecular-scale dynamics
    of lithium ions in thin films of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) containing
    either lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) or lithium
    trifluoroacetate (LiTFA) salts at monomer-to-salt ratios (EO/Li) of 8.3. The
    results are compared with previous β-NMR measurements on pure PEO and PEO
    with lithium triflate (LiOTf) at the same loading [McKenzie et al., J. Am.
    Chem. Soc. 136, 7833 (2014)]. Activated hopping of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> was observed in all of the films above ∼250 K,
    with the hopping parameters strongly correlated with the ionicity of the
    lithium salt rather than the polymer glass transition temperature. The
    pre-exponential factor increases exponentially with ionicity, while the
    activation energy for hopping increases approximately linearly, going from
    6.3±0.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> in PEO:LiTFA to 17.8±0.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> in
    PEO:LiTFSI. The more rapid increase in the pre-exponential factor outweighs
    the effect of the larger activation energy and results in
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> hopping being fastest in PEO followed by
    PEO:LiTFSI, PEO:LiOTf, and PEO:LiTFA.

    We have studied a mosaic of 1T-CrSe<sub>2</sub> single crystals using
    β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance of <sup>8</sup>Li from 4 to 300 K. We
    identify two broad resonances that show no evidence of quadrupolar
    splitting, indicating two magnetically distinct environments for the
    implanted ion. We observe stretched exponential spin lattice relaxation and
    a corresponding rate (1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>) that increases monotonically
    above 200 K, consistent with the onset of ionic diffusion. A pronounced
    maximum in 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> is observed at the low temperature
    magnetic transition near 20 K. Between these limits, 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>
    exhibits a broad minimum with an anomalous absence of strong features in the
    vicinity of structural and magnetic transitions between 150 and 200 K.
    Together, the results suggest <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> site occupation
    within the van der Waals gap between CrSe<sub>2</sub> trilayers. Possible
    origins of the two environments are discussed.
