    Free radical addition to alkenes is an important aspect of radical mediated
    polymerization reactions. In this work, we investigated free radical
    addition to vinylidene fluoride (VDF) in supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>
    (scCO<sub>2</sub>). scCO<sub>2</sub> is an important "green solvent" and
    polymerization is one of the most important applications of this solvent.
    Our results suggest a clear selectivity among different free radical
    reaction channels for reaction of H atom with VDF. In particular the
    preferred reaction channel in the temperature range of 280 to 420 K and
    density range of 0.1 to 0.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup> is the addition to the
    CH<sub>2</sub> side.

    We report rate constants for muonium addition to 1,1-difluoroethylene
    (vinylidene fluoride) in CO<sub>2</sub> at 290-530 K, 40-360 bar, and
    0.05-0.90 g cm<sup>-3</sup>. Rate constants are mapped against their
    thermodynamic conditions, demonstrating the kinetic tuning ability of the
    solvent. The reaction exhibits critical slowing near conditions of maximum
    solvent isothermal compressibility, where activation volumes of
    unprecedentedly large magnitudes on the order of ±10<sup>6</sup>
    cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> are observed. Such values are suggestive of
    pressure being a significant parameter for tuning fluorolkene reactivity.

    We report herein a means to modify the reactivity of alkenes, and
    particularly to modify their selectivity toward reactions with nonpolar
    reactants (e.g., nonpolar free radicals) in supercritical carbon dioxide
    near the critical point. Rate constants for free radical addition of the
    light hydrogen isotope muonium to ethylene, vinylidene fluoride, and
    vinylidene chloride in supercritical carbon dioxide are compared over a
    range of pressures and temperatures. Near carbon dioxide’s critical point,
    the addition to ethylene exhibits critical speeding up, while the
    halogenated analogues display critical slowing. This suggests that
    supercritical carbon dioxide as a solvent may be used to tune alkene
    chemistry in near-critical conditions.

    A β-NMR study was performed on a Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> crystal in
    the metallic state using a beam of spin-polarized <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>
    implanted at a mean depth of 90 nm. The <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>
    spin-lattice relaxation rate is strongly influenced by the onset of
    incommensurate spin fluctuations. The nuclear relaxation rate can be
    explained using previously published bulk <sup>17</sup>O NMR and inelastic
    neutron spectroscopy measurements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility to
    model the hyperfine coupling. A well-resolved quadrupolar-split NMR for
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implies a static stopping position in an
    interstitial site. The <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> Knight shift is highly
    sensitive to the anisotropic static susceptibility.

    By measuring the prototypical antiferromagnet α−Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
    we show that it is possible to determine the static spin orientation and
    dynamic spin correlations within nanometers from an antiferromagnetic
    surface using the nuclear spin polarization of implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> ions detected with β-NMR. Remarkably, the
    first-order Morin spin reorientation in single crystal
    α−Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> occurs at the same temperature at all depths
    between 1 and 100 nm from the (110) surface; however, the implanted nuclear
    spin experiences an increased 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> relaxation rate at
    shallow depths revealing soft-surface magnons. The surface-localized
    dynamics decay towards the bulk with a characteristic length of ε = 11 ±
    1  nm, closely matching the finite-size thresholds of hematite
    nanostructures.

    Chemisorption of muonium onto the surface of gold nanoparticles has been
    observed. Muonium (μ<sup>+</sup>e<sup>-</sup>), a light hydrogen-like atom,
    reacts chemically with uncapped 7 nm gold nanoparticles embedded in
    mesoporous silica (SBA-15) with a strong temperature-dependent rate. The
    addition rate is fast enough to allow coherent spin transfer into a
    diamagnetic muon state on the nanoparticle surface. The muon is well
    established as a sensitive probe of static or slowly fluctuating magnetic
    fields in bulk matter. These results represent the first muon spin rotation
    signal on a nanoparticle surface or any metallic surface. Only weak magnetic
    effects are seen on the surface of these Au nanoparticles consistent with
    Pauli paramagnetism.

    β-detected NMR (β-NMR) has been used to study the molecular-scale dynamics
    of lithium ions in thin films of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) containing
    either lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) or lithium
    trifluoroacetate (LiTFA) salts at monomer-to-salt ratios (EO/Li) of 8.3. The
    results are compared with previous β-NMR measurements on pure PEO and PEO
    with lithium triflate (LiOTf) at the same loading [McKenzie et al., J. Am.
    Chem. Soc. 136, 7833 (2014)]. Activated hopping of
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> was observed in all of the films above ~250 K,
    with the hopping parameters strongly correlated with the ionicity of the
    lithium salt rather than the polymer glass transition temperature. The
    pre-exponential factor increases exponentially with ionicity, while the
    activation energy for hopping increases approximately linearly, going from
    6.3 ± 0.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> in PEO:LiTFA to 17.8 ± 0.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>
    in PEO:LiTFSI. The more rapid increase in the pre-exponential factor
    outweighs the effect of the larger activation energy and results in
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> hopping being fastest in PEO followed by
    PEO:LiTFSI, PEO:LiOTf, and PEO:LiTFA.

    rates for <sup>9</sup>Li and <sup>8</sup>Li in Pt and SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, in
    order to differentiate between magnetic and electric quadrupolar relaxation

    rates <i>R</i><sub>Pt</sub> was found to be 6.82(29), which is close to but
    less than the theoretical limit of ~7.68 for pure magnetic relaxation. In

    Diffusion of Li<sup>+</sup> in (111) oriented thin films of the spinels
    Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> and LiTi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
    has been studied with <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected NMR in the temperature range
    between 5 and 310 K. In Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, the
    spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>) versus temperature
    shows a clear maximum around 100 K (= <i>T</i><sub>max</sub>) which we
    attribute to magnetic freezing of dilute Ti<sup>3+</sup> local magnetic
    moments, consistent with the results of magnetization and muon spin
    relaxation (μ<sup>+</sup>SR) measurements. The decrease in
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> with temperature above <i>T</i><sub>max</sub>
    indicates that Li<sup>+</sup> starts to diffuse with a thermal activation
    energy (<i>E<sub>a</sub></i>) of 0.11(1) eV. In
    LiTi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, on the contrary, as temperature increases
    from 200 K, 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> increases monotonically up to 310 K. This
    suggests that Li also starts to diffuse above 200 K with
    <i>E<sub>a</sub></i> = 0.16(2) eV in LiTi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.
    Comparison with conventional Li-NMR on
    Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> implies that both β-NMR and
    μ<sup>+</sup>SR sense short-range Li motion, i.e., a jump diffusion of
    Li<sup>+</sup> to the nearest neighboring sites.

    We report measurements of the dynamics of isolated
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> in single crystal rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> using
    β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance. From spin-lattice relaxation and
    motional narrowing, we find two sets of thermally activated dynamics: one
    below 100 K and one at higher temperatures. At low temperature, the
    activation barrier is 26.8(6) meV with prefactor 1.23(5) × 10<sup>10</sup>
    s<sup>-1</sup>. We suggest this is unrelated to Li<sup>+</sup> motion and
    rather is a consequence of electron polarons in the vicinity of the
    implanted <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> that are known to become mobile in this
    temperature range. Above 100 K, Li<sup>+</sup> undergoes long-range
    diffusion as an isolated uncomplexed cation, characterized by an activation
    energy and prefactor of 0.32(2) eV and 1.0(5) × 10<sup>16</sup>
    s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, in agreement with macroscopic diffusion
    measurements. These results in the dilute limit from a microscopic probe
    indicate that Li<sup>+</sup> concentration does not limit the diffusivity
    even up to high concentrations but that some key ingredient is missing in
    the calculations of the migration barrier. The anomalous prefactors provide
    further insight into both Li<sup>+</sup> and polaron motion.

    Muon spin rotation/relaxation measurements show clear evidence for magnetism
    in 2.2 nm gold nanoparticles capped with butanethiol. At low temperatures
    (1.8 K), there is significant spin relaxation which decreases as a function
    of both the applied longitudinal magnetic field and increasing temperature.
    The results indicate that there are spatially inhomogeneous electronic
    moments that fluctuate with a wide distribution of correlation times.
    Possible explanations are discussed.

    There is indirect evidence that the dynamics of a polymer near a free
    surface are enhanced compared with the bulk but there are few studies of how
    dynamics varies with depth. β-Detected nuclear spin relaxation of implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> has been used to directly probe the temperature
    and depth dependence of the γ-relaxation mode, which is due to phenyl rings
    undergoing restricted rotation, in thin films of atactic deuterated
    polystyrene (PS-d8) and determine how the depth dependence of dynamics is
    affected by sample processing, such as annealing, floating on water and the
    inclusion of a surfactant, and by the presence of a buried interface. The
    activation energy for the γ-relaxation process is lower near the free
    surface. Annealing the PS-d8 films and then immersing in water to mimic the
    floating procedure used to transfer films had negligible effects on the
    thickness of the region near the free surface with enhanced mobility.
    Measurements on a bilayer film indicate enhanced phenyl ring dynamics near
    the buried interface compared with a single film at the same depth. PS-d8
    films annealed with the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) deposited on
    the surface show enhanced dynamics in the bulk compared with a pure PS-d8
    film and a PS-d8 film where the SDS was washed away. There is less contrast
    between the surface and bulk in the SDS-treated sample, which could account
    for the elimination of the <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> confinement effect observed
    in films containing SDS [Chen and Torkelson, Polymer, 2016, <b>87</b>, 226].

    electronic properties of the three-dimensional topological insulator
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>2</sub>Se using ion-implanted <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected
    nuclear magnetic relaxation and resonance. With implantation energies in the
    range 5-28 keV, the probes penetrate beyond the expected range of the
    topological surface state, but are still within 250 nm of the surface. At
    temperatures above ~150K, spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal
    isolated <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion with an activation energy
    <i>E<sub>A</sub></i> = 0.185(8) eV and attempt frequency
    τ<sup>−1</sup><sub>0</sub> = 8 ± 3 × 10<sup>11</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for
    atomic site-to-site hopping. At lower temperature, we find a linear
    Korringa-type relaxation mechanism with a field-dependent slope and
    intercept, which is accompanied by an anomalous field dependence to the
    resonance shift. We suggest that these may be related to a strong
    contribution from orbital currents or the magnetic freeze-out of charge
    carriers in this heavily compensated semiconductor, but that conventional
    theories are unable to account for the extent of the field dependence.
    Conventional NMR of the stable host nuclei may help elucidate their origin.

    We report measurements of the diffusion rate of isolated ion-implanted
    <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> within ~120  nm of the surface of oriented
    single-crystal rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> using a radiotracer technique. The α
    particles from the <sup>8</sup>Li decay provide a sensitive monitor of the
    distance from the surface and how the depth profile of <sup>8</sup>Li
    evolves with time. The main findings are that the implanted Li<sup>+</sup>
    diffuses and traps at the (001) surface. The <i>T</i> dependence of the
    diffusivity is described by a bi-Arrhenius expression with activation
    energies of 0.3341(21) eV above 200 K, whereas at lower temperatures it has
    a much smaller barrier of 0.0313(15) eV. We consider possible origins for
    the surface trapping, as well the nature of the low-<i>T</i> barrier.

    We report β-detected NMR of ion-implanted <sup>8</sup>Li in a single crystal
    and thin film of the strongly correlated metal LaNiO<sup>3</sup>.
    Spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal two distinct local environments,
    both metallic as evident from <i>T</i>-linear Korringa
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> below 200 K with slopes comparable to other metals. A
    small approximately temperature-independent Knight shift of ~74 ppm is
    observed, yielding a normalized Korringa product characteristic of
    substantial antiferromagnetic correlations. We find no evidence for a
    magnetic transition from 4 to 310 K. The similarity of these features in the
    two very different samples indicates that they are intrinsic and unrelated
    to dilute oxygen vacancies. We attribute the two environments to two
    distinct but similar crystallographic <sup>8</sup>Li sites and not to any
    form of phase inhomogeneity, but this is inconsistent with the conventional
    rhombohedral structure of LaNiO<sup>3</sup>, and also cannot be simply
    explained by the common alternative orthorhombic or monoclinic distortions.

    We demonstrate the application of implanted-ion β-detected NMR as a probe of
    ionic liquid molecular dynamics through the measurement of <sup>8</sup>Li
    spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) and resonance in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
    acetate. The motional narrowing of the resonance and the local maxima in the
    SLR rate, 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, imply sensitivity to subnanosecond
    Li<sup>+</sup> solvation dynamics. From an analysis of
    1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, we extract an activation energy <i>E<sub>A</sub></i>
    = 74.8(1.5) meV and Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann constant <i>T</i><sub>VFT</sub> =
    165.8(0.9) K, in agreement with the dynamic viscosity of the bulk solvent.
    Near the melting point, the lineshape is broad and intense, and the form of
    the relaxation is nonexponential, reflective of our sensitivity to
    heterogeneous dynamics near the glass transition. The depth resolution of
    this technique may later provide a unique means of studying nanoscale
    phenomena in ionic liquids.

    We report a comprehensive muon spin rotation (μSR) study of the prototypical
    magnetoelectric antiferromagnet Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. We find the
    positively charged muon (μ<sup>+</sup>) occupies several distinct
    interstitial sites and displays a rich dynamic behavior involving local
    hopping, thermally activated site transitions, and the formation of a
    charge-neutral complex composed of a muon and an electron polaron. The
    discovery of such a complex has implications for the interpretation of μSR
    spectra in a wide range of magnetic oxides and opens a route to study the
    dopant characteristics of interstitial hydrogen impurities in such
    materials. We address implications arising from implanting a μ<sup>+</sup>
    into a linear magnetoelectric and discuss the challenges of observing a
    local magnetoelectric effect generated by the charge of the muon.

    We have studied a mosaic of 1T-CrSe<sub>2</sub> single crystals using
    β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance of <sup>8</sup>Li from 4 to 300 K. We
    identify two broad resonances that show no evidence of quadrupolar
    splitting, indicating two magnetically distinct environments for the
    implanted ion. We observe stretched exponential spin lattice relaxation and
    a corresponding rate (1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>) that increases monotonically
    above 200 K, consistent with the onset of ionic diffusion. A pronounced
    maximum in 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> is observed at the low temperature
    magnetic transition near 20 K. Between these limits, 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>
    exhibits a broad minimum with an anomalous absence of strong features in the
    vicinity of structural and magnetic transitions between 150 and 200 K.
    Together, the results suggest <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> site occupation
    within the van der Waals gap between CrSe<sub>2</sub> trilayers. Possible
    origins of the two environments are discussed.
