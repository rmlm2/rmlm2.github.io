    <p>
    Transverse field muon spin relaxation was employed to study the reaction
    kinetics of muonium and vinylidene fluoride in sub- and supercritical carbon
    dioxide. Rate constants for the reaction were determined over range of
    thermodynamic conditions spanning 290-530 K and 40-360 bar. This included a
    solvent density range of 0.05-0.90 g cm<sup>-3</sup>, which is more than an
    order of magnitude in difference. This is the first muonium kinetics study
    under conditions of such a large density range and is the largest density
    range for any kinetics study in carbon dioxide.

    <p>
    Three dimensional analysis of the rate constants as a function of
    temperature and pressure indicates that 80 bar ≤ <i>P</i> ≤ 120 bar and
    290 K ≤ <i>T</i> ≤ 330 bar is the thermodynamic range where change in rate
    constant are most affected by small changes in thermodynamic conditions. In
    general, for an increase in solvent density, the reaction rate increases,
    indicating that the reaction is chemically controlled, unlike what is
    usually proposed for free radical reactions in supercritical fluids.
    </p>
    <p>
    Arrhenius temperature dependence was displayed for the reaction rate under
    isodense conditions. This produced a general decrease of activation energy
    as solvent density increased, ranging from 10.4-4.7 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> over
    a density range of 0.11-0.83 g cm<sup>−3</sup>. Activation entropy remained
    largely constant over this range of densities, with an approximate value of
    -59 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>. Maxima in thermal activation
    parameters are observed at a solvent density <i>ρ</i> ≈ 0.55 g
    cm<sup>-3</sup>, likely due to a change in mechanism from activation
    controlled to diffusion controlled reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
    Pressure dependence of the reaction manifested critical reaction slowing for
    isotherms where <i>T</i> ≈ <i>T<sub>c</sub></i>. These produced activation
    volumes on the order of ±10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>−1</sup>,
    which is nearly four orders of magnitude larger than typical values found
    for reactions in supercritical fluids. For isotherms where <i>T</i> >>
    <i>T<sub>c</sub></i>, the critical slowing vanished, and activations volumes
    found in the range of −134 to −220 cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>−1</sup> for
    temperatures between 363-433 K.

    A preliminary computational model was developed to elucidate the primary
    reaction channel for hydrogen atom reactions with vinylidene fluoride in the
    gas phase. The results of this computational work were used to help
    interpret the analogous reaction of muonium with vinylidene fluoride. The
    UB3LYP/6-311++G(3<i>df</i>, 3<i>pd</i>) method and basis set was employed
    for these calculations and produced results which confirmed literature
    suggestions that addition to vinylidene fluoride's protonated carbon is the
    primary reaction channel.

    Microscopic dynamics of isolated lithium in crystalline solids revealed by
    nuclear magnetic relaxation and resonance of <sup>8</sup>Li

    <p>
    This thesis reports measurements on the dynamics of isolated lithium in
    single crystal materials using ion-implanted <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected
    nuclear magnetic resonance. From spin-lattice relaxation and resonance
    measurements, we identify the kinetic parameters describing the ion’s
    site-to-site hop rate – the elementary process in long-range solid-state
    diffusion – and compare the results with theoretical work in the literature,
    as well as experiments at higher concentration. In addition to these "ionic"
    details, the nuclear magnetic resonance probe provides information on the
    electronic properties of the host, whose most intriguing features are also
    discussed.
    </p>

    In the one-dimensional ion conductor rutile
    TiO<sub>2</sub>, we find two sets of thermally activated dynamics: one below
    100 K and another at higher temperatures. We suggest the low temperature
    process is unrelated to lithium motion, but rather a consequence of electron
    polarons in the vicinity of the implanted <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>. Above
    100 K, Li⁺ undergoes diffusion as an isolated uncomplexed cation,
    characterized by an activation energy and prefactor that are in agreement
    with macroscopic diffusion measurements, but not with theory.
    </p>
    <p>
    In Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>2</sub>Se, a topological insulator with layered
    tetradymite structure, implanted <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> undergoes ionic
    diffusion above 150 K, likely in the van der Waals gap between adjacent Te
    planes. A comparison with structurally related materials reveals the
    mobility of isolated Li<sup>+</sup> is exceptional. At lower temperature, we
    find linear Korringa-like relaxation, but with a field dependent slope and
    intercept, accompanied by an anomalous field dependence to the resonance
    shift. We suggest that these may be related to a strong contribution from
    orbital currents or the magnetic freezeout of charge carriers in this
    heavily compensated semiconductor.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the doped tetradymite topological insulators
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>:Ca and Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>:Mn, the
    onset of lithium dynamics is suppressed to above 200 K. At low temperatures,
    the nuclear magnetic resonance properties are those of a heavily doped
    semiconductor in the metallic limit, with Korringa relaxation and a small,
    negative, temperature-dependent Knight shift. From this, we make a detailed
    comparison with isostructural Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>2</sub>Se.
