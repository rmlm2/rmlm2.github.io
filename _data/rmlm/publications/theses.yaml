    <p>This thesis reports measurements on the dynamics of isolated lithium in
    single crystal materials using ion-implanted <sup>8</sup>Li β-detected
    nuclear magnetic resonance. From spin-lattice relaxation and resonance
    measurements, we identify the kinetic parameters describing the ion’s
    site-to-site hop rate – the elementary process in long-range solid-state
    diffusion – and compare the results with theoretical work in the literature,
    as well as experiments at higher concentration. In addition to these "ionic"
    details, the nuclear magnetic resonance probe provides information on the
    electronic properties of the host, whose most intriguing features are also
    discussed.</p> <p>In the one-dimensional ion conductor rutile
    TiO<sub>2</sub>, we find two sets of thermally activated dynamics: one below
    100 K and another at higher temperatures. We suggest the low temperature
    process is unrelated to lithium motion, but rather a consequence of electron
    polarons in the vicinity of the implanted <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>. Above
    100 K, Li⁺ undergoes diffusion as an isolated uncomplexed cation,
    characterized by an activation energy and prefactor that are in agreement
    with macroscopic diffusion measurements, but not with theory.</p> <p>In
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>2</sub>Se, a topological insulator with layered
    tetradymite structure, implanted <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> undergoes ionic
    diffusion above 150 K, likely in the van der Waals gap between adjacent Te
    planes. A comparison with structurally related materials reveals the
    mobility of isolated Li<sup>+</sup> is exceptional. At lower temperature, we
    find linear Korringa-like relaxation, but with a field dependent slope and
    intercept, accompanied by an anomalous field dependence to the resonance
    shift. We suggest that these may be related to a strong contribution from
    orbital currents or the magnetic freezeout of charge carriers in this
    heavily compensated semiconductor.</p> <p>In the doped tetradymite
    topological insulators Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>:Ca and
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>:Mn, the onset of lithium dynamics is suppressed
    to above 200 K. At low temperatures, the nuclear magnetic resonance
    properties are those of a heavily doped semiconductor in the metallic limit,
    with Korringa relaxation and a small, negative, temperature-dependent Knight
    shift. From this, we make a detailed comparison with isostructural
    Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>2</sub>Se.</p>
