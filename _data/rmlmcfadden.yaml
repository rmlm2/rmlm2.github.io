        We report β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) measurements in
        Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>:Ca (BSC) and
        Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>:Mn (BTM) single crystals using
        <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> implanted to depths on the order of 100 nm.
        Above ~200 K, spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) reveals diffusion of
        <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup>, with activation energies of ~0.4 eV (~0.2
        eV) in BSC (BTM). At lower temperatures, the nuclear magnetic resonance
        (NMR) properties are those of a heavily doped semiconductor in the
        metallic limit, with Korringa relaxation and a small, negative,
        temperature-dependent Knight shift in BSC. From this, we make a detailed
        comparison with the isostructural tetradymite
        Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>2</sub>Se (BTS) [McFadden et al., Phys Rev. B 99,
        125201 (2019)]. In the magnetic BTM, the effects of the dilute Mn
        moments predominate, but remarkably the <sup>8</sup>Li signal is not
        wiped out through the magnetic transition at 13 K, with a prominent
        critical peak in the SLR that is suppressed in a high applied field.
        This detailed characterization of the <sup>8</sup>Li NMR response is an
        important step towards using depth-resolved β-NMR to study the
        low-energy properties of the chiral topological surface state (TSS).
        With the bulk NMR response now established in several
        Bi<sub>2</sub>Ch<sub>3</sub> tetradymite topological insulators (TIs),
        the prospect of directly probing their chiral TSS using the depth
        resolution afforded by β-NMR remains strong.

        We have studied a mosaic of 1T-CrSe<sub>2</sub> single crystals using
        β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance of <sup>8</sup>Li from 4 to 300 K.
        We identify two broad resonances that show no evidence of quadrupolar
        splitting, indicating two magnetically distinct environments for the
        implanted ion. We observe stretched exponential spin lattice relaxation
        and a corresponding rate (1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>) that increases
        monotonically above 200 K, consistent with the onset of ionic diffusion.
        A pronounced maximum in 1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> is observed at the low
        temperature magnetic transition near 20 K. Between these limits,
        1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> exhibits a broad minimum with an anomalous
        absence of strong features in the vicinity of structural and magnetic
        transitions between 150 and 200 K. Together, the results suggest
        <sup>8</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> site occupation within the van der Waals gap
        between CrSe<sub>2</sub> trilayers. Possible origins of the two
        environments are discussed.

        It has long been desirable to develop a spin-1/2 nucleus as a probe for
        β-detected NMR studies of solid materials. As a pure magnetic probe, it
        would greatly compliment our most extensively used nucleus
        <sup>8</sup>Li (spin-2), which is sensitive to both dipolar and
        quadrupolar interactions. Following the recent successful polarization
        of spin-1/2 <sup>31</sup>Mg at TRIUMF, we report here on its use to
        study solids where host magnesium atoms occupy lattice sites with cubic
        symmetry - a situation most directly comparable to (stable)
        <sup>25</sup>Mg NMR. We show preliminary results in: rocksalt MgO;
        spinel MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>; and antifluorite Mg<sub>2</sub>Si,
        which is an interesting semiconducting thermoelectric. Deviations from
        the results with conventional <sup>25</sup>Mg NMR are attributed to the
        systematics associated with the β-NMR technique. The <sup>31</sup>Mg
        decay chain is found to complicate the extraction of spin–lattice
        relaxation rates due to a time-dependent background signal introduced by
        its progeny. The prospect of further use of 31Mg as a β-NMR probe for
        the study of condensed matter is good.
