# MUD

MUon Data (MUD) files are the storage format for results from µSR and β-NMR
experiments performed at [TRIUMF](https://www.triumf.ca/).
All (non-commercial) µSR and β-NMR "runs" (i.e., measurements) recorded at
[TRIUMF] can be retrieved from the [MUD "archive"],
which is maintained by the [CMMS] group.

While the original documentation for the MUD format is given
[elsewhere](http://cmms.triumf.ca/mud/ "MUon Data (MUD) access"),
here I give a slightly modified version,
mainly with enhanced typsetting and presentation.
