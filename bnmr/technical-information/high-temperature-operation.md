# High Temperature Operation
{: .no_toc }


In 2020, the high-field spectrometer internals were modified to accomodate
measurements at higher temperatures (up to 400 K)!
In addition to these internal modifications, it is necessary to swap out the
<i>F</i> (i.e., forward) detector on the high-voltage platform for one
compatible with the extended <i>T</i>-range.

A video explaining how to swap the two detectors
(and prevent the new one from metling) can be found here:
