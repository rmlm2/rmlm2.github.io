# SRIM

The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (`SRIM`) is a collection of software
for calculations/simulations dealing with ion transport in matter.
This includes:

- ion stopping and range in targets,
- ion implantation,
- sputtering,
- ion transmisstion,
- and ion beam therapy.

Further details can be found at the `SRIM`
[homepage](http://www.srim.org/ "SRIM - The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter").

Though the software is free, it is [closed source] and writtin in
(the now defunct language) [Visual Basic].
Niether of these traits are particularly appealing
(or sensible) by modern standards.
Nevertheless,
it offers a user friendly interface for a number of
complicated tasks that are useful for many branches of science
(e.g., the stopping profile of an implanted ion).
