# rmlmcfadden.github.io

This repository contains the the source code for my personal website
[rmlmcfadden.github.io](https://rmlmcfadden.github.io).
It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted for free using
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The content of the site mainly caters to my own (largely academic) interests,
but some of it may be of use to you too!
