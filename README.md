# rmlmcfadden.github.io

This repository contains the the source code for my personal website,
accessible at <https://rmlmcfadden.github.io>.

The pages are formatted using the
[Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs)
theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
with the rendered content hosted (for free) by
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The site mainly caters to my own (academic) interests,
but some of the content may be of use to you too!
