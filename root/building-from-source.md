Building ROOT from source is no easy task - just ask anyone whos done it!

Fortunately, the quality of the documentation has improved dramatically over the
years, which has to some extent mitigated the difficulty of the task.

## Dependencies

ROOT provides list of dependence for different operating systems,
which can be found [here](https://root.cern/install/dependencies/).

## Build instructions

The official build instructions can be found
[here](https://root.cern/install/build_from_source/).

Really, the build instructions are better passed to a script that can be easily
edited and executed - there are simply too many options to type out for each
build!

Some day, I will share my own build script...
