# MUD

MUon Data (MUD) files are the storage format for results from
[µSR]({% link musr.md %}) and [β-NMR]({% link bnmr.md %})
experiments performed at [TRIUMF].
All (non-commercial) [µSR]({% link musr.md %}) and [β-NMR]({% link bnmr.md %})
"runs" (i.e., measurements) recorded at [TRIUMF]
can be retrieved from the [MUD "archive"],
which is maintained by [TRIUMF]'s [CMMS] group.

While the original documentation for the MUD format is given
[elsewhere](http://cmms.triumf.ca/mud/ "MUon Data (MUD) access"),
here I give a slightly modified version,
mainly with enhanced typsetting and presentation.
