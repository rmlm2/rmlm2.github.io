# MUD

MUon Data (MUD) files are the storage format for results from
[µSR]({% link musr.md %}) and [β-NMR]({% link bnmr.md %})
experiments performed at [TRIUMF].

All (non-commercial) measurments,
colloquially referred to as "runs",
can be retrieved from a comprehensive "[archive]"
maintained by [TRIUMF]'s [CMMS] group.

While the original documentation for the MUD format is given at
<https://cmms.triumf.ca/mud/>,
here I give a slightly modified version,
mainly with enhanced typsetting and presentation.
